"""This module tests SyntaxErrors.

Here's an example of the sort of thing that is tested.

>>> def f(x):
...     global x
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: name 'x' is parameter and global

The tests are all raise SyntaxErrors.  They were created by checking
each C call that raises SyntaxError.  There are several modules that
raise these exceptions-- ast.c, compile.c, future.c, pythonrun.c, and
symtable.c.

The parser itself outlaws a lot of invalid syntax.  None of these
errors are tested here at the moment.  We should add some tests; since
there are infinitely many programs with invalid syntax, we would need
to be judicious in selecting some.

The compiler generates a synthetic module name for code executed by
doctest.  Since all the code comes from the same module, a suffix like
[1] is appended to the module name, As a consequence, changing the
order of tests in this module means renumbering all the errors after
it.  (Maybe we should enable the ellipsis option for these tests.)

In ast.c, syntax errors are raised by calling ast_error().

Errors from set_context():

>>> obj.None = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

>>> None = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to keyword

It's a syntax error to assign to the empty tuple.  Why isn't it an
error to assign to the empty list?  It will always raise some error at
runtime.

>>> () = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to ()

>>> f() = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call

>>> del f()
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't delete function call

>>> a + 1 = 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator

>>> (x for x in x) = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to generator expression

>>> 1 = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal

>>> "abc" = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal

>>> b"" = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal

>>> `1` = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

If the left-hand side of an assignment is a list or tuple, an illegal
expression inside that contain should still cause a syntax error.
This test just checks a couple of cases rather than enumerating all of
them.

>>> (a, "b", c) = (1, 2, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal

>>> [a, b, c + 1] = [1, 2, 3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator

>>> a if 1 else b = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
SyntaxError: can't assign to conditional expression

and generator expression arguments separately.  This test combines the
three.

Test continue in finally in weird combinations.

continue in for loop under finally should be ok.

    >>> def test():
    ...     try:
    ...         pass
    ...     finally:
    ...         for abc in range(10):
    ...             continue
    ...     print(abc)
    >>> test()
    9

Start simple, a continue in a finally should not be allowed.

    >>> def test():
    ...    for abc in range(10):
    ...        try:
    ...            pass

This is essentially a continue in a finally which should not be allowed.

There is one test for a break that is not in a loop.  The compiler
uses a single data structure to keep track of try-finally and loops,
so we need to be sure that a break is actually inside a loop.  If it
isn't, there should be a syntax error.

   >>> try:
   ...     print(1)
   ...     break
   ...     print(2)
   ... finally:
   ...     print(3)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
   SyntaxError: 'break' outside loop

This should probably raise a better error than a SystemError (or none at all).
In 2.5 there was a missing exception and an assert was triggered in a debug
build.  The number of blocks must be greater than CO_MAXBLOCKS.  SF #1565514
