What's New in Python 3.7.2 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2018-12-11*

Security
--------

- bpo-34812: The :option:`-I` command line option (run Python in isolated
  mode) is now also copied by the :mod:`multiprocessing` and
  :mod:`distutils` modules when spawning child processes. Previously, only
  :option:`-E` and :option:`-s` options (enabled by :option:`-I`) were
  copied.

- bpo-34791: The xml.sax and xml.dom.domreg no longer use environment
  variables to override parser implementations when
  sys.flags.ignore_environment is set by -E or -I arguments.

Core and Builtins

  unittest.mock.MagicProxy (name, parent & from_kall) are now prefixed with
  _mock_ in order to prevent clashes with widely used object attributes.
  Fixed minor typo in test function name.

- bpo-35372: Fixed the code page decoder for input longer than 2 GiB
  containing undecodable bytes.

- bpo-35336: Fix PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=1 environment variable: only coerce the

  read one byte beyond the end of the memory allocation.

- bpo-35214: The interpreter and extension modules have had annotations
  added so that they work properly under clang's Memory Sanitizer.  A new
  configure flag --with-memory-sanitizer has been added to make test builds
  of this nature easier to perform.

- bpo-35193: Fix an off by one error in the bytecode peephole optimizer
  where it could read bytes beyond the end of bounds of an array when
  removing unreachable code. This bug was present in every release of Python

  original implementation and return the result of using the side effect the
  same way that it is done with return_value.

- bpo-34172: Revert the fix for this issue previously released in 3.7.1

- bpo-10496: :func:`posixpath.expanduser` now returns the input *path*
  unchanged if the ``HOME`` environment variable is not set and the current
  user has no home directory (if the current user identifier doesn't exist
  in the password database). This change fix the :mod:`site` module if the
  current user doesn't exist in the password database (if the user has no
  home directory).

  instead of deprecated :func:`imp.reload`.

- bpo-940286: pydoc's ``Helper.showtopic()`` method now prints the cross
  references of a topic correctly.

- bpo-34164: :func:`base64.b32decode` could raise UnboundLocalError or

  leave it unchanged: it will modify the copy, so that the same
  ``STARTUPINFO`` object can be used multiple times.

- bpo-34010: Fixed a performance regression for reading streams with
  tarfile. The buffered read should use a list, instead of appending to a
  bytes object.

  *headers* or *trailers* arguments (on BSD-based OSes and macOS).

- bpo-33899: Tokenize module now implicitly emits a NEWLINE when provided
  with input that does not have a trailing new line.  This behavior now

- bpo-34537: Fix ``test_gdb.test_strings()`` when ``LC_ALL=C`` and GDB was
  compiled with Python 3.6 or earlier.

- bpo-34587: test_socket: Remove RDSTest.testCongestion(). The test tries to
  fill the receiver's socket buffer and expects an error. But the RDS
  protocol doesn't require that. Moreover, the Linux implementation of RDS
  expects that the producer of the messages reduces its rate, it's not the
  role of the receiver to trigger an error. The test fails on Fedora 28 by
  design, so just remove it.

- bpo-34661: Fix test_shutil if unzip doesn't support -t.

- bpo-34200: Fixed non-deterministic flakiness of test_pkg by not using the
  scary test.support.module_cleanup() logic to save and restore sys.modules
  contents between test cases.

- bpo-34594: Fix usage of hardcoded ``errno`` values in the tests.

- bpo-34542: Use 3072 RSA keys and SHA-256 signature for test certs and
  keys.

- bpo-11193: Remove special condition for AIX in
  `test_subprocess.test_undecodable_env`

- bpo-34490: On AIX with AF_UNIX family sockets getsockname() does not
  provide 'sockname', so skip calls to transport.get_extra_info('sockname')

- bpo-34391: Fix ftplib test for TLS 1.3 by reading from data socket.

- bpo-34399: Update all RSA keys and DH params to use at least 2048 bits.

- bpo-33746: Fix test_unittest when run in verbose mode.

- bpo-33901: Fix test_dbm_gnu on macOS with gdbm 1.15: add a larger value to
  make sure that the file size changes.

- bpo-33873: Fix a bug in ``regrtest`` that caused an extra test to run if
  --huntrleaks/-R was used. Exit with error in case that invalid parameters
  are specified to --huntrleaks/-R (at least one warmup run and one
  repetition must be used).

- bpo-32663: Making sure the `SMTPUTF8SimTests` class of tests gets run in
  test_smtplib.py.

Build
-----

- bpo-34710: Fixed SSL module build with OpenSSL & pedantic CFLAGS.

- bpo-34582: Add JUnit XML output for regression tests and update Azure
  DevOps builds.

  ``HAVE_LINUX_VM_SOCKETS_H`` and ``HAVE_SOCKADDR_ALG`` be undefined.

- bpo-34121: Fix detection of C11 atomic support on clang.

- bpo-30345: Add -g to LDFLAGS when compiling with LTO to get debug symbols.

- bpo-33648: The --with-c-locale-warning configuration flag has been
  removed. It has had no effect for about a year.

Windows
-------

- bpo-34770: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in pyshellext.cpp.

- bpo-34603: Fix returning structs from functions produced by MSVC

- bpo-34581: Guard MSVC-specific code in socketmodule.c with ``#ifdef
  _MSC_VER``.

- bpo-34062: Fixed the '--list' and '--list-paths' arguments for the py.exe
  launcher

- bpo-34225: Ensure INCLUDE and LIB directories do not end with a backslash.

- bpo-34006: Revert line length limit for Windows help docs. The line-length
  limit is not needed because the pages appear in a separate app rather than
  on a browser tab.  It can also interact badly with the DPI setting.

- bpo-31546: Restore running PyOS_InputHook while waiting for user input at
  the prompt. The restores integration of interactive GUI windows (such as
  Matplotlib figures) with the prompt on Windows.

- bpo-30237: Output error when ReadConsole is canceled by
  CancelSynchronousIo instead of crashing.

- bpo-29097: Fix bug where :meth:`datetime.fromtimestamp` erronously throws
  an :exc:`OSError` on Windows for values between 0 and 86400. Patch by
  Ammar Askar.

macOS
-----

- bpo-34370: Have macOS 10.9+ installer builds for 3.7.1rc and 3.6.7rc use a
  development snapshot of Tk 8.6 (post-8.6.8) to mitigate certain scroller
  issues seen with IDLE and tkinter apps.

- bpo-34405: Update to OpenSSL 1.1.0i for macOS installer builds.

- bpo-33635: In macOS stat on some file descriptors (/dev/fd/3 f.e) will
  result in bad file descriptor OSError. Guard against this exception was
  added in is_dir, is_file and similar methods. DirEntry.is_dir can also
  throw this exception so _RecursiveWildcardSelector._iterate_directories
  was also extended with the same error ignoring pattern.

- bpo-31903: In :mod:`_scproxy`, drop the GIL when calling into
  ``SystemConfiguration`` to avoid deadlocks.

IDLE
----

- bpo-34548: Use configured color theme for read-only text views.

- bpo-1529353: Enable "squeezing" of long outputs in the shell, to avoid
  performance degradation and to clean up the history without losing it.
  Squeezed outputs may be copied, viewed in a separate window, and
  "unsqueezed".

- bpo-34047: Fixed mousewheel scrolling direction on macOS.

- bpo-34275: Make IDLE calltips always visible on Mac. Some MacOS-tk
  combinations need .update_idletasks(). Patch by Kevin Walzer.

- bpo-34120: Fix unresponsiveness after closing certain windows and dialogs.

- bpo-33975: Avoid small type when running htests. Since part of the purpose
  of human-viewed tests is to determine that widgets look right, it is
  important that they look the same for testing as when running IDLE.

- bpo-33905: Add test for idlelib.stackview.StackBrowser.

- bpo-33924: Change mainmenu.menudefs key 'windows' to 'window'. Every other
  menudef key is lowercase version of main menu entry.

- bpo-33906: Rename idlelib.windows as window Match Window on the main menu
  and remove last plural module name.

- bpo-33917: Fix and document idlelib/idle_test/template.py. The revised
  file compiles, runs, and tests OK.  idle_test/README.txt explains how to
  use it to create new IDLE test files.

- bpo-33904: IDLE: In rstrip, rename class RstripExtension as Rstrip

- bpo-33907: For consistency and clarity, rename an IDLE module and classes.
  Module calltips and its class CallTips are now calltip and Calltip. In
  module calltip_w, class CallTip is now CalltipWindow.

- bpo-33856: Add "help" in the welcome message of IDLE

- bpo-33839: IDLE: refactor ToolTip and CallTip and add documentation and
  tests

- bpo-33855: Minimally test all IDLE modules. Add missing files, import
  module, instantiate classes, and check coverage. Check existing files.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-32962: python-gdb now catchs ``UnicodeDecodeError`` exceptions when
  calling ``string()``.

- bpo-32962: python-gdb now catchs ValueError on read_var(): when Python has
  no debug symbols for example.

C API
-----

- bpo-34247: Fix Py_Initialize() regression introduced in 3.7.0: read
  environment variables like PYTHONOPTIMIZE.

- bpo-23927: Fixed :exc:`SystemError` in
  :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords` when the ``w*`` format unit is used
  for optional parameter.

  docstring.

C API
-----

- bpo-33932: Calling Py_Initialize() twice does nothing, instead of failing
  with a fatal error: restore the Python 3.6 behaviour.

  astimezone() method.

- bpo-30805: Avoid race condition with debug logging

- bpo-33694: asyncio: Fix a race condition causing data loss on
  pause_reading()/resume_reading() when using the ProactorEventLoop.

  of an unhandled error; mark SSLTransport as closed if it is aborted.

- bpo-33767: The concatenation (``+``) and repetition (``*``) sequence
  operations now raise :exc:`TypeError` instead of :exc:`SystemError` when
  performed on :class:`mmap.mmap` objects.  Patch by Zackery Spytz.

  modules written in C++.

Windows
-------

IDLE
----

- bpo-33656: On Windows, add API call saying that tk scales for DPI. On
  Windows 8.1+ or 10, with DPI compatibility properties of the Python binary
  unchanged, and a monitor resolution greater than 96 DPI, this should make

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-33622: Fixed a leak when the garbage collector fails to add an object
  with the ``__del__`` method or referenced by it into the
  :data:`gc.garbage` list. :c:func:`PyGC_Collect` can now be called when an
  exception is set and preserves it.

- bpo-33509: Fix module_globals parameter of warnings.warn_explicit(): don't
  crash if module_globals is not a dict.

- bpo-20104: The new `os.posix_spawn` added in 3.7.0b1 was removed as we are
  still working on what the API should look like.  Expect this in 3.8
  instead.

- bpo-33475: Fixed miscellaneous bugs in converting annotations to strings
  and optimized parentheses in the string representation.

- bpo-33391: Fix a leak in set_symmetric_difference().

- bpo-28055: Fix unaligned accesses in siphash24(). Patch by Rolf Eike Beer.

- bpo-32911: Due to unexpected compatibility issues discovered during
  downstream beta testing, reverted :issue:`29463`. ``docstring`` field is
  removed from Module, ClassDef, FunctionDef, and AsyncFunctionDef ast nodes
  which was added in 3.7a1.  Docstring expression is restored as a first
  statement in their body. Based on patch by Inada Naoki.

- bpo-32684: Fix gather to propagate cancellation of itself even with
  return_exceptions.

- bpo-33654: Support protocol type switching in SSLTransport.set_protocol().

- bpo-33674: Pause the transport as early as possible to further reduce the
  risk of data_received() being called before connection_made().

- bpo-33674: Fix a race condition in SSLProtocol.connection_made() of
  asyncio.sslproto: start immediately the handshake instead of using
  call_soon(). Previously, data_received() could be called before the
  handshake started, causing the handshake to hang or fail.

- bpo-31647: Fixed bug where calling write_eof() on a
  _SelectorSocketTransport after it's already closed raises AttributeError.

- bpo-32610: Make asyncio.all_tasks() return only pending tasks.

- bpo-32410: Avoid blocking on file IO in sendfile fallback code

  the decoding. Based on patch by c-fos.

- bpo-33570: Change TLS 1.3 cipher suite settings for compatibility with
  OpenSSL 1.1.1-pre6 and newer. OpenSSL 1.1.1 will have TLS 1.3 ciphers
  enabled by default.

- bpo-28556: Do not simplify arguments to `typing.Union`. Now
  `Union[Manager, Employee]` is not simplified to `Employee` at runtime.
  Such simplification previously caused several bugs and limited
  possibilities for introspection.

- bpo-33540: Add a new ``block_on_close`` class attribute to
  ``ForkingMixIn`` and ``ThreadingMixIn`` classes of :mod:`socketserver`.

- bpo-33548: tempfile._candidate_tempdir_list should consider common TEMP
  locations

  FieldStorage use the given errors (needed for Twisted).  Patch by Amber
  Brown.

- bpo-33495: Change dataclasses.Fields repr to use the repr of each of its
  members, instead of str.  This makes it more clear what each field
  actually represents.  This is especially true for the 'type' member.

- bpo-33453: Fix dataclasses to work if using literal string type
  annotations or if using PEP 563 "Postponed Evaluation of Annotations".
  Only specific string prefixes are detected for both ClassVar ("ClassVar"
  and "typing.ClassVar") and InitVar ("InitVar" and "dataclasses.InitVar").

- bpo-28556: Minor fixes in typing module: add annotations to
  ``NamedTuple.__new__``, pass ``*args`` and ``**kwds`` in
  ``Generic.__new__``.  Original PRs by Paulius Šarka and Chad Dombrova.

- bpo-20087: Updated alias mapping with glibc 2.27 supported locales.

- bpo-33422: Fix trailing quotation marks getting deleted when looking up
  byte/string literals on pydoc. Patch by Andrés Delfino.

  available with OpenSSL 1.1.0h or 1.1.1.

- bpo-16865: Support arrays >=2GiB in :mod:`ctypes`.  Patch by Segev Finer.

*Release date: 2018-05-02*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-33363: Raise a SyntaxError for ``async with`` and ``async for``
  statements outside of async functions.

- bpo-33128: Fix a bug that causes PathFinder to appear twice on
  sys.meta_path. Patch by Pablo Galindo Salgado.

- bpo-33205: Change dict growth function from
  ``round_up_to_power_2(used*2+hashtable_size/2)`` to
  ``round_up_to_power_2(used*3)``.  Previously, dict is shrinked only when
  ``used == 0``. Now dict has more chance to be shrinked.

- bpo-29922: Improved error messages in 'async with' when ``__aenter__()``
  or ``__aexit__()`` return non-awaitable object.

- bpo-33199: Fix ``ma_version_tag`` in dict implementation is uninitialized
  when copying from key-sharing dict.

  ``cgitb.html()``. Patch by Stéphane Blondon.

- bpo-33185: Fixed regression when running pydoc with the :option:`-m`
  switch. (The regression was introduced in 3.7.0b3 by the resolution of
  :issue:`33053`)

  This fix also changed pydoc to add ``os.getcwd()`` to :data:`sys.path`
  when necessary, rather than adding ``"."``.

- bpo-33169: Delete entries of ``None`` in :data:`sys.path_importer_cache`
  when :meth:`importlib.machinery.invalidate_caches` is called.

- bpo-33217: Deprecate looking up non-Enum objects in Enum classes and Enum
  members (will raise :exc:`TypeError` in 3.8+).

  StopIteration in a generator into a return-statement.

- bpo-33209: End framing at the end of C implementation of
  :func:`pickle.Pickler.dump`.

- bpo-20104: Improved error handling and fixed a reference leak in
  :func:`os.posix_spawn()`.

- bpo-33175: In dataclasses, Field.__set_name__ now looks up the
  __set_name__ special method on the class, not the instance, of the default
  value.

- bpo-33097: Raise RuntimeError when ``executor.submit`` is called during
  interpreter shutdown.

- bpo-31908: Fix output of cover files for ``trace`` module command-line
  tool. Previously emitted cover files only when ``--missing`` option was
  used. Patch by Michael Selik.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-33378: Add Korean language switcher for https://docs.python.org/3/

- bpo-33276: Clarify that the ``__path__`` attribute on modules cannot be
  just any value.

- bpo-33201: Modernize documentation for writing C extension types.

- bpo-33195: Deprecate ``Py_UNICODE`` usage in ``c-api/arg`` document.
  ``Py_UNICODE`` related APIs are deprecated since Python 3.3, but it is
  missed in the document.

- bpo-8243: Add a note about curses.addch and curses.addstr exception
  behavior when writing outside a window, or pad.

- bpo-32337: Update documentation related with ``dict`` order.

Tests
-----

- bpo-33358: Fix ``test_embed.test_pre_initialization_sys_options()`` when
  the interpreter is built with ``--enable-shared``.

  is passed macros on the command line.

- bpo-33393: Update config.guess and config.sub files.

- bpo-33377: Add new triplets for mips r6 and riscv variants (used in
  extension suffixes).

- bpo-32232: By default, modules configured in `Modules/Setup` are no longer
  built with `-DPy_BUILD_CORE`. Instead, modules that specifically need that
  preprocessor definition include it in their individual entries.

- bpo-33182: The embedding tests can once again be built with clang 6.0

Windows
-------

- bpo-33184: Update Windows installer to use OpenSSL 1.1.0h.

macOS
-----

- bpo-33184: Update macOS installer build to use OpenSSL 1.1.0h.

IDLE
----

- bpo-21474: Update word/identifier definition from ascii to unicode. In
  text and entry boxes, this affects selection by double-click, movement
  left/right by control-left/right, and deletion left/right by
  control-BACKSPACE/DEL.

- bpo-33204: IDLE: consistently color invalid string prefixes. A 'u' string
  prefix cannot be paired with either 'r' or 'f'. Consistently color as much
  of the prefix, starting at the right, as is valid. Revise and extend
  colorizer test.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-33189: :program:`pygettext.py` now recognizes only literal strings as
  docstrings and translatable strings, and rejects bytes literals and
  f-string expressions.

- bpo-31920: Fixed handling directories as arguments in the ``pygettext``
  script. Based on patch by Oleg Krasnikov.

- bpo-29673: Fix pystackv and pystack gdbinit macros.

What's New in Python 3.7.0 beta 3?
==================================

*Release date: 2018-03-29*

Security
--------

- bpo-33136: Harden ssl module against LibreSSL CVE-2018-8970.
  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host() is called with an explicit namelen. A new
  test ensures that NULL bytes are not allowed.

- bpo-33001: Minimal fix to prevent buffer overrun in os.symlink on Windows

- bpo-32981: Regexes in difflib and poplib were vulnerable to catastrophic
  backtracking. These regexes formed potential DOS vectors (REDOS). They
  have been refactored. This resolves CVE-2018-1060 and CVE-2018-1061. Patch
  by Jamie Davis.

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-33053: When using the -m switch, sys.path[0] is now explicitly
  expanded as the *starting* working directory, rather than being left as
  the empty path (which allows imports from the current working directory at
  the time of the import)

- bpo-33018: Improve consistency of errors raised by ``issubclass()`` when
  called with a non-class and an abstract base class as the first and second
  arguments, respectively. Patch by Josh Bronson.

- bpo-33041: Fixed jumping when the function contains an ``async for`` loop.

- bpo-33026: Fixed jumping out of "with" block by setting f_lineno.

- bpo-33005: Fix a crash on fork when using a custom memory allocator (ex:
  using PYTHONMALLOC env var). _PyGILState_Reinit() and
  _PyInterpreterState_Enable() now use the default RAW memory allocator to
  allocate a new interpreters mutex on fork.

- bpo-17288: Prevent jumps from 'return' and 'exception' trace events.

- bpo-32836: Don't use temporary variables in cases of list/dict/set
  comprehensions

Library
-------

- bpo-33141: Have Field objects pass through __set_name__ to their default
  values, if they have their own __set_name__.

- bpo-33096: Allow ttk.Treeview.insert to insert iid that has a false
  boolean value. Note iid=0 and iid=False would be same. Patch by Garvit
  Khatri.

- bpo-32873: Treat type variables and special typing forms as immutable by
  copy and pickle.  This fixes several minor issues and inconsistencies, and
  improves backwards compatibility with Python 3.6.

- bpo-33134: When computing dataclass's __hash__, use the lookup table to
  contain the function which returns the __hash__ value.  This is an
  improvement over looking up a string, and then testing that string to see
  what to do.

- bpo-33127: The ssl module now compiles with LibreSSL 2.7.1.

- bpo-32505: Raise TypeError if a member variable of a dataclass is of type
  Field, but doesn't have a type annotation.

- bpo-33078: Fix the failure on OSX caused by the tests relying on
  sem_getvalue

- bpo-33116: Add 'Field' to dataclasses.__all__.

- bpo-32896: Fix an error where subclassing a dataclass with a field that
  uses a default_factory would generate an incorrect class.

- bpo-33100: Dataclasses: If a field has a default value that's a
  MemberDescriptorType, then it's from that field being in __slots__, not an
  actual default value.

- bpo-32953: If a non-dataclass inherits from a frozen dataclass, allow
  attributes to be added to the derived class.  Only attributes from the
  frozen dataclass cannot be assigned to.  Require all dataclasses in a
  hierarchy to be either all frozen or all non-frozen.

- bpo-33061: Add missing ``NoReturn`` to ``__all__`` in typing.py

- bpo-33078: Fix the size handling in multiprocessing.Queue when a pickling
  error occurs.

- bpo-33064: lib2to3 now properly supports trailing commas after ``*args``
  and ``**kwargs`` in function signatures.

- bpo-33056: FIX properly close leaking fds in
  concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.

- bpo-33021: Release the GIL during fstat() calls, avoiding hang of all
  threads when calling mmap.mmap(), os.urandom(), and random.seed().  Patch
  by Nir Soffer.

- bpo-31804: Avoid failing in multiprocessing.Process if the standard
  streams are closed or None at exit.

- bpo-33037: Skip sending/receiving data after SSL transport closing.

- bpo-27683: Fix a regression in :mod:`ipaddress` that result of
  :meth:`hosts` is empty when the network is constructed by a tuple
  containing an integer mask and only 1 bit left for addresses.

- bpo-32999: Fix C implementation of ``ABC.__subclasscheck__(cls,
  subclass)`` crashed when ``subclass`` is not a type object.

- bpo-33009: Fix inspect.signature() for single-parameter partialmethods.

- bpo-32969: Expose several missing constants in zlib and fix corresponding
  documentation.

- bpo-32056: Improved exceptions raised for invalid number of channels and
  sample width when read an audio file in modules :mod:`aifc`, :mod:`wave`
  and :mod:`sunau`.

- bpo-32844: Fix wrong redirection of a low descriptor (0 or 1) to stderr in
  subprocess if another low descriptor is closed.

- bpo-32857: In :mod:`tkinter`, ``after_cancel(None)`` now raises a
  :exc:`ValueError` instead of canceling the first scheduled function.
  Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31639: http.server now exposes a ThreadedHTTPServer class and uses it
  when the module is run with ``-m`` to cope with web browsers pre-opening
  sockets.

- bpo-27645: :class:`sqlite3.Connection` now exposes a
  :class:`~sqlite3.Connection.backup` method, if the underlying SQLite
  library is at version 3.6.11 or higher.  Patch by Lele Gaifax.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-33126: Document PyBuffer_ToContiguous().

- bpo-27212: Modify documentation for the :func:`islice` recipe to consume
  initial values up to the start index.

- bpo-28247: Update :mod:`zipapp` documentation to describe how to make
  standalone applications.

- bpo-18802: Documentation changes for ipaddress.  Patch by Jon Foster and
  Berker Peksag.

- bpo-27428: Update documentation to clarify that ``WindowsRegistryFinder``
  implements ``MetaPathFinder``. (Patch by Himanshu Lakhara)

Tests
-----

- bpo-32872: Avoid regrtest compatibility issue with namespace packages.

- bpo-32517: Fix failing ``test_asyncio`` on macOS 10.12.2+ due to transport
  of ``KqueueSelector`` loop was not being closed.

- bpo-19417: Add test_bdb.py.

Build
-----

- bpo-33163: Upgrade pip to 9.0.3 and setuptools to v39.0.1.

Windows
-------

- bpo-33016: Fix potential use of uninitialized memory in
  nt._getfinalpathname

- bpo-32903: Fix a memory leak in os.chdir() on Windows if the current
  directory is set to a UNC path.

macOS
-----

- bpo-32726: Build and link with private copy of Tcl/Tk 8.6 for the macOS
  10.6+ installer. The 10.9+ installer variant already does this.  This
  means that the Python 3.7 provided by the python.org macOS installers no
  longer need or use any external versions of Tcl/Tk, either system-provided
  or user-installed, such as ActiveTcl.

IDLE
----

- bpo-32984: Set ``__file__`` while running a startup file.  Like Python,
  IDLE optionally runs one startup file in the Shell window before
  presenting the first interactive input prompt.  For IDLE, ``-s`` runs a
  file named in environmental variable  :envvar:`IDLESTARTUP` or
  :envvar:`PYTHONSTARTUP`; ``-r file`` runs ``file``.  Python sets
  ``__file__`` to the startup file name before running the file and unsets
  it before the first prompt.  IDLE now does the same when run normally,
  without the ``-n`` option.

- bpo-32940: Simplify and rename StringTranslatePseudoMapping in pyparse.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-32885: Add an ``-n`` flag for ``Tools/scripts/pathfix.py`` to disable
  automatic backup creation (files with ``~`` suffix).

C API
-----

- bpo-33042: Embedding applications may once again call
  PySys_ResetWarnOptions, PySys_AddWarnOption, and PySys_AddXOption prior to
  calling Py_Initialize.

- bpo-32374: Document that m_traverse for multi-phase initialized modules
  can be called with m_state=NULL, and add a sanity check


What's New in Python 3.7.0 beta 2?
==================================

*Release date: 2018-02-27*

Security
--------

- bpo-28414: The ssl module now allows users to perform their own IDN
  en/decoding when using SNI.

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-32889: Update Valgrind suppression list to account for the rename of
  ``Py_ADDRESS_IN_RANG`` to ``address_in_range``.

- bpo-31356: Remove the new API added in bpo-31356 (gc.ensure_disabled()
  context manager).

- bpo-32305: For namespace packages, ensure that both ``__file__`` and
  ``__spec__.origin`` are set to None.

- bpo-32303: Make sure ``__spec__.loader`` matches ``__loader__`` for
  namespace packages.

- bpo-32711: Fix the warning messages for Python/ast_unparse.c. Patch by
  Stéphane Wirtel

- bpo-32583: Fix possible crashing in builtin Unicode decoders caused by
  write out-of-bound errors when using customized decode error handlers.

Library
-------

- bpo-32960: For dataclasses, disallow inheriting frozen from non-frozen
  classes, and also disallow inheriting non-frozen from frozen classes. This
  restriction will be relaxed at a future date.

- bpo-32713: Fixed tarfile.itn handling of out-of-bounds float values. Patch
  by Joffrey Fuhrer.

- bpo-32951: Direct instantiation of SSLSocket and SSLObject objects is now
  prohibited. The constructors were never documented, tested, or designed as
  public constructors. Users were suppose to use ssl.wrap_socket() or
  SSLContext.

- bpo-32929: Remove the tri-state parameter "hash", and add the boolean
  "unsafe_hash". If unsafe_hash is True, add a __hash__ function, but if a
  __hash__ exists, raise TypeError.  If unsafe_hash is False, add a __hash__
  based on the values of eq= and frozen=.  The unsafe_hash=False behavior is
  the same as the old hash=None behavior.  unsafe_hash=False is the default,
  just as hash=None used to be.

- bpo-32947: Add OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT and test workaround for TLSv1.3
  for future compatibility with OpenSSL 1.1.1.

- bpo-30622: The ssl module now detects missing NPN support in LibreSSL.

- bpo-32922: dbm.open() now encodes filename with the filesystem encoding
  rather than default encoding.

- bpo-32859: In ``os.dup2``, don't check every call whether the ``dup3``
  syscall exists or not.

- bpo-32556: nt._getfinalpathname, nt._getvolumepathname and
  nt._getdiskusage now correctly convert from bytes.

- bpo-25988: Emit a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` when using or importing an ABC
  directly from :mod:`collections` rather than from :mod:`collections.abc`.

- bpo-21060: Rewrite confusing message from setup.py upload from "No dist
  file created in earlier command" to the more helpful "Must create and
  upload files in one command".

- bpo-32852: Make sure sys.argv remains as a list when running trace.

- bpo-31333: ``_abc`` module is added.  It is a speedup module with C
  implementations for various functions and methods in ``abc``.  Creating an
  ABC subclass and calling ``isinstance`` or ``issubclass`` with an ABC
  subclass are up to 1.5x faster. In addition, this makes Python start-up up
  to 10% faster.

  Note that the new implementation hides internal registry and caches,
  previously accessible via private attributes ``_abc_registry``,
  ``_abc_cache``, and ``_abc_negative_cache``.  There are three debugging
  helper methods that can be used instead ``_dump_registry``,
  ``_abc_registry_clear``, and ``_abc_caches_clear``.

- bpo-32841: Fixed `asyncio.Condition` issue which silently ignored
  cancellation after notifying and cancelling a conditional lock. Patch by
  Bar Harel.

- bpo-32819: ssl.match_hostname() has been simplified and no longer depends
  on re and ipaddress module for wildcard and IP addresses. Error reporting
  for invalid wildcards has been improved.

- bpo-32394: socket: Remove
  TCP_FASTOPEN,TCP_KEEPCNT,TCP_KEEPIDLE,TCP_KEEPINTVL flags on older version
  Windows during run-time.

- bpo-31787: Fixed refleaks of ``__init__()`` methods in various modules.
  (Contributed by Oren Milman)

- bpo-30157: Fixed guessing quote and delimiter in csv.Sniffer.sniff() when
  only the last field is quoted.  Patch by Jake Davis.

- bpo-32792: collections.ChainMap() preserves the order of the underlying
  mappings.

- bpo-32775: :func:`fnmatch.translate()` no longer produces patterns which
  contain set operations. Sets starting with '[' or containing '--', '&&',
  '~~' or '||' will be interpreted differently in regular expressions in
  future versions. Currently they emit warnings. fnmatch.translate() now
  avoids producing patterns containing such sets by accident.

- bpo-32622: Implement native fast sendfile for Windows proactor event loop.

- bpo-32777: Fix a rare but potential pre-exec child process deadlock in
  subprocess on POSIX systems when marking file descriptors inheritable on
  exec in the child process.  This bug appears to have been introduced in
  3.4.

- bpo-32647: The ctypes module used to depend on indirect linking for
  dlopen. The shared extension is now explicitly linked against libdl on
  platforms with dl.

- bpo-32741: Implement ``asyncio.TimerHandle.when()`` method.

- bpo-32691: Use mod_spec.parent when running modules with pdb

- bpo-32734: Fixed ``asyncio.Lock()`` safety issue which allowed acquiring
  and locking the same lock multiple times, without it being free. Patch by
  Bar Harel.

- bpo-32727: Do not include name field in SMTP envelope from address. Patch
  by Stéphane Wirtel

- bpo-31453: Add TLSVersion constants and SSLContext.maximum_version /
  minimum_version attributes. The new API wraps OpenSSL 1.1
  https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_min_proto_version.html
  feature.

- bpo-24334: Internal implementation details of ssl module were cleaned up.
  The SSLSocket has one less layer of indirection. Owner and session
  information are now handled by the SSLSocket and SSLObject constructor.
  Channel binding implementation has been simplified.

- bpo-31848: Fix the error handling in Aifc_read.initfp() when the SSND
  chunk is not found. Patch by Zackery Spytz.

- bpo-32585: Add Ttk spinbox widget to :mod:`tkinter.ttk`.  Patch by Alan D
  Moore.

- bpo-32221: Various functions returning tuple containing IPv6 addresses now
  omit ``%scope`` part since the same information is already encoded in
  *scopeid* tuple item. Especially this speeds up :func:`socket.recvfrom`
  when it receives multicast packet since useless resolving of network
  interface name is omitted.

- bpo-30693: The TarFile class now recurses directories in a reproducible
  way.

- bpo-30693: The ZipFile class now recurses directories in a reproducible
  way.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-28124: The ssl module function ssl.wrap_socket() has been
  de-emphasized and deprecated in favor of the more secure and efficient
  SSLContext.wrap_socket() method.

- bpo-17232: Clarify docs for -O and -OO.  Patch by Terry Reedy.

- bpo-32436: Add documentation for the contextvars module (PEP 567).

- bpo-32800: Update link to w3c doc for xml default namespaces.

- bpo-11015: Update :mod:`test.support` documentation.

- bpo-8722: Document :meth:`__getattr__` behavior when property :meth:`get`
  method raises :exc:`AttributeError`.

- bpo-32614: Modify RE examples in documentation to use raw strings to
  prevent :exc:`DeprecationWarning` and add text to REGEX HOWTO to highlight
  the deprecation.

- bpo-31972: Improve docstrings for `pathlib.PurePath` subclasses.

Tests
-----

- bpo-31809: Add tests to verify connection with secp ECDH curves.

Build
-----

- bpo-32898: Fix the python debug build when using COUNT_ALLOCS.

Windows
-------

- bpo-32901: Update Tcl and Tk versions to 8.6.8

- bpo-31966: Fixed WindowsConsoleIO.write() for writing empty data.

- bpo-32409: Ensures activate.bat can handle Unicode contents.

- bpo-32457: Improves handling of denormalized executable path when
  launching Python.

- bpo-32370: Use the correct encoding for ipconfig output in the uuid
  module. Patch by Segev Finer.

- bpo-29248: Fix :func:`os.readlink` on Windows, which was mistakenly
  treating the ``PrintNameOffset`` field of the reparse data buffer as a
  number of characters instead of bytes. Patch by Craig Holmquist and SSE4.

macOS
-----

- bpo-32901: Update macOS 10.9+ installer to Tcl/Tk 8.6.8.

IDLE
----

- bpo-32916: Change ``str`` to ``code`` in pyparse.

- bpo-32905: Remove unused code in pyparse module.

- bpo-32874: Add tests for pyparse.

- bpo-32837: Using the system and place-dependent default encoding for
  open() is a bad idea for IDLE's system and location-independent files.

- bpo-32826: Add "encoding=utf-8" to open() in IDLE's test_help_about. GUI
  test test_file_buttons() only looks at initial ascii-only lines, but
  failed on systems where open() defaults to 'ascii' because readline()
  internally reads and decodes far enough ahead to encounter a non-ascii
  character in CREDITS.txt.

- bpo-32765: Update configdialog General tab docstring to add new widgets to
  the widget list.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-32222: Fix pygettext not extracting docstrings for functions with type
  annotated arguments. Patch by Toby Harradine.


What's New in Python 3.7.0 beta 1?
==================================

*Release date: 2018-01-30*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-32703: Fix coroutine's ResourceWarning when there's an active error
  set when it's being finalized.

- bpo-32650: Pdb and other debuggers dependent on bdb.py will correctly step
  over (next command) native coroutines. Patch by Pablo Galindo.

- bpo-28685: Optimize list.sort() and sorted() by using type specialized
  comparisons when possible.

- bpo-32685: Improve suggestion when the Python 2 form of print statement is
  either present on the same line as the header of a compound statement or
  else terminated by a semi-colon instead of a newline. Patch by Nitish
  Chandra.

- bpo-32697: Python now explicitly preserves the definition order of
  keyword-only parameters.  It's always preserved their order, but this
  behavior was never guaranteed before; this behavior is now guaranteed and
  tested.

- bpo-32690: The locals() dictionary now displays in the lexical order that
  variables were defined.  Previously, the order was reversed.

- bpo-32677: Add ``.isascii()`` method to ``str``, ``bytes`` and
  ``bytearray``. It can be used to test that string contains only ASCII
  characters.

- bpo-32670: Enforce :pep:`479` for all code.

  This means that manually raising a StopIteration exception from a
  generator is prohibited for all code, regardless of whether 'from
  __future__ import generator_stop' was used or not.

- bpo-32591: Added built-in support for tracking the origin of coroutine
  objects; see sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth and
  CoroutineType.cr_origin. This replaces the asyncio debug mode's use of
  coroutine wrapping for native coroutine objects.

- bpo-31368: Expose preadv and pwritev system calls in the os module. Patch
  by Pablo Galindo

- bpo-32544: ``hasattr(obj, name)`` and ``getattr(obj, name, default)`` are
  about 4 times faster than before when ``name`` is not found and ``obj``
  doesn't override ``__getattr__`` or ``__getattribute__``.

- bpo-26163: Improved frozenset() hash to create more distinct hash values
  when faced with datasets containing many similar values.

- bpo-32550: Remove the STORE_ANNOTATION bytecode.

- bpo-20104: Expose posix_spawn as a low level API in the os module.
  (removed before 3.7.0rc1)

- bpo-24340: Fixed estimation of the code stack size.

- bpo-32436: Implement :pep:`567` Context Variables.

- bpo-18533: ``repr()`` on a dict containing its own ``values()`` or
  ``items()`` no longer raises ``RecursionError``; OrderedDict similarly.
  Instead, use ``...``, as for other recursive structures.  Patch by Ben
  North.

- bpo-20891: Py_Initialize() now creates the GIL. The GIL is no longer
  created "on demand" to fix a race condition when PyGILState_Ensure() is
  called in a non-Python thread.

- bpo-32028: Leading whitespace is now correctly ignored when generating
  suggestions for converting Py2 print statements to Py3 builtin print
  function calls. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.

- bpo-31179: Make dict.copy() up to 5.5 times faster.

- bpo-31113: Get rid of recursion in the compiler for normal control flow.

Library
-------

- bpo-25988: Deprecate exposing the contents of collections.abc in the
  regular collections module.

- bpo-31429: The default cipher suite selection of the ssl module now uses a
  blacklist approach rather than a hard-coded whitelist. Python no longer
  re-enables ciphers that have been blocked by OpenSSL security update.
  Default cipher suite selection can be configured on compile time.

- bpo-30306: contextlib.contextmanager now releases the arguments passed to
  the underlying generator as soon as the context manager is entered.
  Previously it would keep them alive for as long as the context manager was
  alive, even when not being used as a function decorator. Patch by Martin
  Teichmann.

- bpo-21417: Added support for setting the compression level for
  zipfile.ZipFile.

- bpo-32251: Implement asyncio.BufferedProtocol (provisional API).

- bpo-32513: In dataclasses, allow easier overriding of dunder methods
  without specifying decorator parameters.

- bpo-32660: :mod:`termios` makes available ``FIONREAD``, ``FIONCLEX``,
  ``FIOCLEX``, ``FIOASYNC`` and ``FIONBIO`` also under Solaris/derivatives.

- bpo-27931: Fix email address header parsing error when the username is an
  empty quoted string. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-32659: Under Solaris and derivatives, :class:`os.stat_result` provides
  a st_fstype attribute.

- bpo-32662: Implement Server.start_serving(), Server.serve_forever(), and
  Server.is_serving() methods.  Add 'start_serving' keyword parameter to
  loop.create_server() and loop.create_unix_server().

- bpo-32391: Implement :meth:`asyncio.StreamWriter.wait_closed` and
  :meth:`asyncio.StreamWriter.is_closing` methods

- bpo-32643: Make Task._step, Task._wakeup and Future._schedule_callbacks
  methods private.

- bpo-32630: Refactor decimal module to use contextvars to store decimal
  context.

- bpo-32622: Add :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoop.sendfile` method.

- bpo-32304: distutils' upload command no longer corrupts tar files ending
  with a CR byte, and no longer tries to convert CR to CRLF in any of the
  upload text fields.

- bpo-32502: uuid.uuid1 no longer raises an exception if a 64-bit hardware
  address is encountered.

- bpo-32596: ``concurrent.futures`` imports ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` and
  ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` lazily (using :pep:`562`). It makes ``import
  asyncio`` about 15% faster because asyncio uses only
  ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` by default.

- bpo-31801: Add ``_ignore_`` to ``Enum`` so temporary variables can be used
  during class construction without being turned into members.

- bpo-32576: Use queue.SimpleQueue() in places where it can be invoked from
  a weakref callback.

- bpo-32574: Fix memory leak in asyncio.Queue, when the queue has limited
  size and it is full, the cancelation of queue.put() can cause a memory
  leak. Patch by: José Melero.

- bpo-32521: The nis module is now compatible with new libnsl and headers
  location.

- bpo-32467: collections.abc.ValuesView now inherits from
  collections.abc.Collection.

- bpo-32473: Improve ABCMeta._dump_registry() output readability

- bpo-32102: New argument ``capture_output`` for subprocess.run

- bpo-32521: glibc has removed Sun RPC. Use replacement libtirpc headers and
  library in nis module.

- bpo-32493: UUID module fixes build for FreeBSD/OpenBSD

- bpo-32503: Pickling with protocol 4 no longer creates too small frames.

- bpo-29237: Create enum for pstats sorting options

- bpo-32454: Add close(fd) function to the socket module.

- bpo-25942: The subprocess module is now more graceful when handling a
  Ctrl-C KeyboardInterrupt during subprocess.call, subprocess.run, or a
  Popen context manager.  It now waits a short amount of time for the child
  (presumed to have also gotten the SIGINT) to exit, before continuing the
  KeyboardInterrupt exception handling.  This still includes a SIGKILL in
  the call() and run() APIs, but at least the child had a chance first.

- bpo-32433: The hmac module now has hmac.digest(), which provides an
  optimized HMAC digest.

- bpo-28134: Sockets now auto-detect family, type and protocol from file
  descriptor by default.

- bpo-32404: Fix bug where :meth:`datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp` did not
  call __new__ in :class:`datetime.datetime` subclasses.

- bpo-32403: Improved speed of :class:`datetime.date` and
  :class:`datetime.datetime` alternate constructors.

- bpo-32228: Ensure that ``truncate()`` preserves the file position (as
  reported by ``tell()``) after writes longer than the buffer size.

- bpo-32410: Implement ``loop.sock_sendfile`` for asyncio event loop.

- bpo-22908: Added seek and tell to the ZipExtFile class. This only works if
  the file object used to open the zipfile is seekable.

- bpo-32373: Add socket.getblocking() method.

- bpo-32248: Add :mod:`importlib.resources` and
  :class:`importlib.abc.ResourceReader` as the unified API for reading
  resources contained within packages.  Loaders wishing to support resource
  reading must implement the :meth:`get_resource_reader()` method.
  File-based and zipimport-based loaders both implement these APIs.
  :class:`importlib.abc.ResourceLoader` is deprecated in favor of these new
  APIs.

- bpo-32320: collections.namedtuple() now supports default values.

- bpo-29302: Add contextlib.AsyncExitStack. Patch by Alexander Mohr and Ilya
  Kulakov.

- bpo-31961: *Removed in Python 3.7.0b2.* The *args* argument of
  subprocess.Popen can now be a :term:`path-like object`. If *args* is given
  as a sequence, it's first element can now be a :term:`path-like object` as
  well.

- bpo-31900: The :func:`locale.localeconv` function now sets temporarily the
  ``LC_CTYPE`` locale to the ``LC_NUMERIC`` locale to decode
  ``decimal_point`` and ``thousands_sep`` byte strings if they are non-ASCII
  or longer than 1 byte, and the ``LC_NUMERIC`` locale is different than the
  ``LC_CTYPE`` locale. This temporary change affects other threads.

  Same change for the :meth:`str.format` method when formatting a number
  (:class:`int`, :class:`float`, :class:`float` and subclasses) with the
  ``n`` type (ex: ``'{:n}'.format(1234)``).

- bpo-31853: Use super().method instead of socket.method in SSLSocket.  They
  were there most likely for legacy reasons.

- bpo-31399: The ssl module now uses OpenSSL's X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host()
  and X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip() API to verify hostname and IP addresses.
  Subject common name fallback can be disabled with
  SSLContext.hostname_checks_common_name.

- bpo-14976: Add a queue.SimpleQueue class, an unbounded FIFO queue with a
  reentrant C implementation of put().

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-32724: Add references to some commands in the documentation of Pdb.
  Patch by Stéphane Wirtel

- bpo-32649: Complete the C API documentation, profiling and tracing part
  with the newly added per-opcode events.

- bpo-17799: Explain real behaviour of sys.settrace and sys.setprofile and
  their C-API counterparts regarding which type of events are received in
  each function. Patch by Pablo Galindo Salgado.

Tests
-----

- bpo-32721: Fix test_hashlib to not fail if the _md5 module is not built.

- bpo-28414: Add test cases for IDNA 2003 and 2008 host names. IDNA 2003
  internationalized host names are working since bpo-31399 has landed. IDNA
  2008 are still broken.

- bpo-32604: Add a new "_xxsubinterpreters" extension module that exposes
  the existing subinterpreter C-API and a new cross-interpreter data sharing
  mechanism. The module is primarily intended for more thorough testing of
  the existing subinterpreter support.

  Note that the _xxsubinterpreters module has been removed in 3.7.0rc1.

- bpo-32602: Add test certs and test for ECDSA cert and EC/RSA dual mode.

- bpo-32549: On Travis CI, Python now Compiles and uses a local copy of
  OpenSSL 1.1.0g for testing.

Build
-----

- bpo-32635: Fix segfault of the crypt module when libxcrypt is provided
  instead of libcrypt at the system.

- bpo-32598: Use autoconf to detect OpenSSL libs, headers and supported
  features. The ax_check_openssl M4 macro uses pkg-config to locate OpenSSL
  and falls back to manual search.

- bpo-32593: Drop support of FreeBSD 9 and older.

- bpo-29708: If the :envvar:`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable is set,
  :mod:`py_compile` will always create hash-based ``.pyc`` files.

Windows
-------

- bpo-32588: Create standalone _distutils_findvs module and add missing
  _queue module to installer.

- bpo-29911: Ensure separate Modify and Uninstall buttons are displayed.

- bpo-32507: Use app-local UCRT install rather than the proper update for
  old versions of Windows.

macOS
-----

- bpo-32726: Provide an additional, more modern macOS installer variant that
  supports macOS 10.9+ systems in 64-bit mode only.  Upgrade the supplied
  third-party libraries to OpenSSL 1.1.0g and to SQLite 3.22.0.  The 10.9+
  installer now links with and supplies its own copy of Tcl/Tk 8.6.

- bpo-28440: No longer add /Library/Python/3.x/site-packages to sys.path for
  macOS framework builds to avoid future conflicts.

C API
-----

- bpo-32681: Fix uninitialized variable 'res' in the C implementation of
  os.dup2. Patch by Stéphane Wirtel

- bpo-10381: Add C API access to the ``datetime.timezone`` constructor and
  ``datetime.timzone.UTC`` singleton.


What's New in Python 3.7.0 alpha 4?
===================================

*Release date: 2018-01-08*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-31975: The default warning filter list now starts with a
  "default::DeprecationWarning:__main__" entry, so deprecation warnings are
  once again shown by default in single-file scripts and at the interactive
  prompt.

- bpo-32226: ``__class_getitem__`` is now an automatic class method.

- bpo-32399: Add AIX uuid library support for RFC4122 using uuid_create() in
  libc.a

- bpo-32390: Fix the compilation failure on AIX after the f_fsid field has
  been added to the object returned by os.statvfs() (issue #32143). Original
  patch by Michael Felt.

- bpo-32379: Make MRO computation faster when a class inherits from a single
  base.

- bpo-32259: The error message of a TypeError raised when unpack
  non-iterable is now more specific.

- bpo-27169: The ``__debug__`` constant is now optimized out at compile
  time. This fixes also bpo-22091.

- bpo-32329: The :option:`-R` option now turns on hash randomization when
  the :envvar:`PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable is set to ``0``.
  Previously, the option was ignored. Moreover,
  ``sys.flags.hash_randomization`` is now properly set to 0 when hash
  randomization is turned off by ``PYTHONHASHSEED=0``.

- bpo-30416: The optimizer is now protected from spending much time doing
  complex calculations and consuming much memory for creating large
  constants in constant folding. Increased limits for constants that can be
  produced in constant folding.

- bpo-32282: Fix an unnecessary ifdef in the include of VersionHelpers.h in
  socketmodule on Windows.

- bpo-30579: Implement TracebackType.__new__ to allow Python-level creation
  of traceback objects, and make TracebackType.tb_next mutable.

- bpo-32260: Don't byte swap the input keys to the SipHash algorithm on
  big-endian platforms. This should ensure siphash gives consistent results
  across platforms.

- bpo-31506: Improve the error message logic for object.__new__ and
  object.__init__. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.

- bpo-20361: ``-b`` and ``-bb`` now inject ``'default::BytesWarning'`` and
  ``error::BytesWarning`` entries into ``sys.warnoptions``, ensuring that
  they take precedence over any other warning filters configured via the
  ``-W`` option or the ``PYTHONWARNINGS`` environment variable.

- bpo-32230: `-X dev` now injects a ``'default'`` entry into
  sys.warnoptions, ensuring that it behaves identically to actually passing
  ``-Wdefault`` at the command line.

- bpo-29240: Add a new UTF-8 mode: implementation of the :pep:`540`.

- bpo-32226: :pep:`560`: Add support for ``__mro_entries__`` and
  ``__class_getitem__``. Implemented by Ivan Levkivskyi.

- bpo-32225: :pep:`562`: Add support for module ``__getattr__`` and
  ``__dir__``. Implemented by Ivan Levkivskyi.

- bpo-31901: The `atexit` module now has its callback stored per
  interpreter.

- bpo-31650: Implement :pep:`552` (Deterministic pycs). Python now supports
  invalidating bytecode cache files bashed on a source content hash rather
  than source last-modified time.

- bpo-29469: Move constant folding from bytecode layer to AST layer.
  Original patch by Eugene Toder.

Library
-------

- bpo-32506: Now that dict is defined as keeping insertion order, drop
  OrderedDict and just use plain dict.

- bpo-32279: Add params to dataclasses.make_dataclasses(): init, repr, eq,
  order, hash, and frozen.  Pass them through to dataclass().

- bpo-32278: Make type information optional on dataclasses.make_dataclass().
  If omitted, the string 'typing.Any' is used.

- bpo-32499: Add dataclasses.is_dataclass(obj), which returns True if obj is
  a dataclass or an instance of one.

- bpo-32468: Improve frame repr() to mention filename, code name and current
  line number.

- bpo-23749: asyncio: Implement loop.start_tls()

- bpo-32441: Return the new file descriptor (i.e., the second argument) from
  ``os.dup2``. Previously, ``None`` was always returned.

- bpo-32422: ``functools.lru_cache`` uses less memory (3 words for each
  cached key) and takes about 1/3 time for cyclic GC.

- bpo-31721: Prevent Python crash from happening when Future._log_traceback
  is set to True manually.  Now it can only be set to False, or a ValueError
  is raised.

- bpo-32415: asyncio: Add Task.get_loop() and Future.get_loop()

- bpo-26133: Don't unsubscribe signals in asyncio UNIX event loop on
  interpreter shutdown.

- bpo-32363: Make asyncio.Task.set_exception() and set_result() raise
  NotImplementedError. Task._step() and Future.__await__() raise proper
  exceptions when they are in an invalid state, instead of raising an
  AssertionError.

- bpo-32357: Optimize asyncio.iscoroutine() and loop.create_task() for
  non-native coroutines (e.g. async/await compiled with Cython).

  'loop.create_task(python_coroutine)' used to be 20% faster than
  'loop.create_task(cython_coroutine)'.  Now, the latter is as fast.

- bpo-32356: asyncio.transport.resume_reading() and pause_reading() are now
  idempotent. New transport.is_reading() method is added.

- bpo-32355: Optimize asyncio.gather(); now up to 15% faster.

- bpo-32351: Use fastpath in asyncio.sleep if delay<0 (2x boost)

- bpo-32348: Optimize asyncio.Future schedule/add/remove callback.  The
  optimization shows 3-6% performance improvements of async/await code.

- bpo-32331: Fix socket.settimeout() and socket.setblocking() to keep
  socket.type as is. Fix socket.socket() constructor to reset any bit flags
  applied to socket's type.  This change only affects OSes that have
  SOCK_NONBLOCK and/or SOCK_CLOEXEC.

- bpo-32248: Add :class:`importlib.abc.ResourceReader` as an ABC for loaders
  to provide a unified API for reading resources contained within packages.
  Also add :mod:`importlib.resources` as the port of
  ``importlib_resources``.

- bpo-32311: Implement asyncio.create_task(coro) shortcut

- bpo-32327: Convert asyncio functions that were documented as coroutines to
  coroutines. Affected functions: loop.sock_sendall, loop.sock_recv,
  loop.sock_accept, loop.getaddrinfo, loop.getnameinfo.

- bpo-32323: :func:`urllib.parse.urlsplit()` does not convert zone-id
  (scope) to lower case for scoped IPv6 addresses in hostnames now.

- bpo-32302: Fix bdist_wininst of distutils for CRT v142: it binary
  compatible with CRT v140.

- bpo-29711: Fix ``stop_serving`` in asyncio proactor loop kill all
  listening servers

- bpo-32308: :func:`re.sub()` now replaces empty matches adjacent to a
  previous non-empty match.

- bpo-29970: Abort asyncio SSLProtocol connection if handshake not complete
  within 10s

- bpo-32314: Implement asyncio.run().

- bpo-17852: Revert incorrect fix based on misunderstanding of
  _Py_PyAtExit() semantics.

- bpo-32296: Implement asyncio._get_running_loop() and get_event_loop() in
  C. This makes them 4x faster.

- bpo-32250: Implement ``asyncio.current_task()`` and
  ``asyncio.all_tasks()``. Add helpers intended to be used by alternative
  task implementations: ``asyncio._register_task``, ``asyncio._enter_task``,
  ``asyncio._leave_task`` and ``asyncio._unregister_task``. Deprecate
  ``asyncio.Task.current_task()`` and ``asyncio.Task.all_tasks()``.

- bpo-32255: A single empty field is now always quoted when written into a
  CSV file. This allows to distinguish an empty row from a row consisting of
  a single empty field. Patch by Licht Takeuchi.

- bpo-32277: Raise ``NotImplementedError`` instead of ``SystemError`` on
  platforms where ``chmod(..., follow_symlinks=False)`` is not supported.
  Patch by Anthony Sottile.

- bpo-30050: New argument warn_on_full_buffer to signal.set_wakeup_fd lets
  you control whether Python prints a warning on stderr when the wakeup fd
  buffer overflows.

- bpo-29137: The ``fpectl`` library has been removed. It was never enabled
  by default, never worked correctly on x86-64, and it changed the Python
  ABI in ways that caused unexpected breakage of C extensions.

- bpo-32273: Move asyncio.test_utils to test.test_asyncio.

- bpo-32272: Remove asyncio.async() function.

- bpo-32269: Add asyncio.get_running_loop() function.

- bpo-32265: All class and static methods of builtin types now are correctly
  classified by inspect.classify_class_attrs() and grouped in pydoc ouput.
  Added types.ClassMethodDescriptorType for unbound class methods of builtin
  types.

- bpo-32253: Deprecate ``yield from lock``, ``await lock``, ``with (yield
  from lock)`` and ``with await lock`` for asyncio synchronization
  primitives.

- bpo-22589: Changed MIME type of .bmp from 'image/x-ms-bmp' to 'image/bmp'

- bpo-32193: Convert asyncio to use *async/await* syntax. Old styled ``yield
  from`` is still supported too.

- bpo-32206: Add support to run modules with pdb

- bpo-32227: ``functools.singledispatch`` now supports registering
  implementations using type annotations.

- bpo-15873: Added new alternate constructors
  :meth:`datetime.datetime.fromisoformat`,
  :meth:`datetime.time.fromisoformat` and
  :meth:`datetime.date.fromisoformat` as the inverse operation of each
  classes's respective ``isoformat`` methods.

- bpo-32199: The getnode() ip getter now uses 'ip link' instead of 'ip link
  list'.

- bpo-32143: os.statvfs() includes the f_fsid field from statvfs(2)

- bpo-26439: Fix ctypes.util.find_library() for AIX by implementing
  ctypes._aix.find_library() Patch by: Michael Felt

- bpo-31993: The pickler now uses less memory when serializing large bytes
  and str objects into a file.  Pickles created with protocol 4 will require
  less memory for unpickling large bytes and str objects.

- bpo-27456: Ensure TCP_NODELAY is set on Linux. Tests by Victor Stinner.

- bpo-31778: ast.literal_eval() is now more strict. Addition and subtraction
  of arbitrary numbers no longer allowed.

- bpo-31802: Importing native path module (``posixpath``, ``ntpath``) now
  works even if the ``os`` module still is not imported.

- bpo-30241: Add contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager. Patch by Jelle
  Zijlstra.

- bpo-31699: Fix deadlocks in
  :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` when task arguments or
  results cause pickling or unpickling errors. This should make sure that
  calls to the :class:`ProcessPoolExecutor` API always eventually return.

- bpo-15216: ``TextIOWrapper.reconfigure()`` supports changing *encoding*,
  *errors*, and *newline*.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-32418: Add get_loop() method to Server and AbstractServer classes.

Tests
-----

- bpo-32252: Fix faulthandler_suppress_crash_report() used to prevent core
  dump files when testing crashes. getrlimit() returns zero on success.

- bpo-32002: Adjust C locale coercion testing for the empty locale and POSIX
  locale cases to more readily adjust to platform dependent behaviour.

Windows
-------

- bpo-19764: Implement support for `subprocess.Popen(close_fds=True)` on
  Windows. Patch by Segev Finer.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-24960: 2to3 and lib2to3 can now read pickled grammar files using
  pkgutil.get_data() rather than probing the filesystem. This lets 2to3 and
  lib2to3 work when run from a zipfile.

C API
-----

- bpo-32030: Py_Initialize() doesn't reset the memory allocators to default
  if the ``PYTHONMALLOC`` environment variable is not set.

- bpo-29084: Undocumented C API for OrderedDict has been excluded from the
  limited C API. It was added by mistake and actually never worked in the
  limited C API.

- bpo-32264: Moved the pygetopt.h header into internal/, since it has no
  public APIs.

- bpo-32241: :c:func:`Py_SetProgramName` and :c:func:`Py_SetPythonHome` now
  take the ``const wchar *`` arguments instead of ``wchar *``.


What's New in Python 3.7.0 alpha 3?
===================================

*Release date: 2017-12-05*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-32176: co_flags.CO_NOFREE is now always set correctly by the code
  object constructor based on freevars and cellvars, rather than needing to
  be set correctly by the caller. This ensures it will be cleared
  automatically when additional cell references are injected into a modified
  code object and function.

- bpo-10544: Yield expressions are now deprecated in comprehensions and
  generator expressions. They are still permitted in the definition of the
  outermost iterable, as that is evaluated directly in the enclosing scope.

- bpo-32137: The repr of deeply nested dict now raises a RecursionError
  instead of crashing due to a stack overflow.

- bpo-32096: Revert memory allocator changes in the C API: move structures
  back from _PyRuntime to Objects/obmalloc.c. The memory allocators are once
  again initialized statically, and so PyMem_RawMalloc() and
  Py_DecodeLocale() can be called before _PyRuntime_Initialize().

- bpo-32043: Add a new "developer mode": new "-X dev" command line option to
  enable debug checks at runtime.

- bpo-32023: SyntaxError is now correctly raised when a generator expression
  without parenthesis is used instead of an inheritance list in a class
  definition. The duplication of the parentheses can be omitted only on
  calls.

- bpo-32012: SyntaxError is now correctly raised when a generator expression
  without parenthesis is passed as an argument, but followed by a trailing
  comma. A generator expression always needs to be directly inside a set of
  parentheses and cannot have a comma on either side.

- bpo-28180: A new internal ``_Py_SetLocaleFromEnv(category)`` helper
  function has been added in order to improve the consistency of behaviour
  across different ``libc`` implementations (e.g. Android doesn't support
  setting the locale from the environment by default).

- bpo-31949: Fixed several issues in printing tracebacks
  (PyTraceBack_Print()).

  * Setting sys.tracebacklimit to 0 or less now suppresses printing tracebacks.
  * Setting sys.tracebacklimit to None now causes using the default limit.
  * Setting sys.tracebacklimit to an integer larger than LONG_MAX now means using
    the limit LONG_MAX rather than the default limit.
  * Fixed integer overflows in the case of more than 2**31 traceback items on
    Windows.
  * Fixed output errors handling.

- bpo-30696: Fix the interactive interpreter looping endlessly when no
  memory.

- bpo-20047: Bytearray methods partition() and rpartition() now accept only
  bytes-like objects as separator, as documented.  In particular they now
  raise TypeError rather of returning a bogus result when an integer is
  passed as a separator.

- bpo-21720: BytesWarning no longer emitted when the *fromlist* argument of
  ``__import__()`` or the ``__all__`` attribute of the module contain bytes
  instances.

- bpo-31845: Environment variables are once more read correctly at
  interpreter startup.

- bpo-28936: Ensure that lexically first syntax error involving a parameter
  and ``global`` or ``nonlocal`` is detected first at a given scope. Patch
  by Ivan Levkivskyi.

- bpo-31825: Fixed OverflowError in the 'unicode-escape' codec and in
  codecs.escape_decode() when decode an escaped non-ascii byte.

- bpo-31618: The per-frame tracing logic added in 3.7a1 has been altered so
  that ``frame->f_lineno`` is updated before either ``"line"`` or
  ``"opcode"`` events are emitted. Previously, opcode events were emitted
  first, and therefore would occasionally see stale line numbers on the
  frame. The behavior of this feature has changed slightly as a result: when
  both ``f_trace_lines`` and ``f_trace_opcodes`` are enabled, line events
  now occur first.

- bpo-28603: Print the full context/cause chain of exceptions on interpreter
  exit, even if an exception in the chain is unhashable or compares equal to
  later ones. Patch by Zane Bitter.

- bpo-31786: Fix timeout rounding in the select module to round correctly
  negative timeouts between -1.0 and 0.0. The functions now block waiting
  for events as expected. Previously, the call was incorrectly non-blocking.
  Patch by Pablo Galindo.

- bpo-31781: Prevent crashes when calling methods of an uninitialized
  ``zipimport.zipimporter`` object. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-30399: Standard repr() of BaseException with a single argument no
  longer contains redundant trailing comma.

- bpo-31626: Fixed a bug in debug memory allocator.  There was a write to
  freed memory after shrinking a memory block.

- bpo-30817: `PyErr_PrintEx()` clears now the ignored exception that may be
  raised by `_PySys_SetObjectId()`, for example when no memory.

Library
-------

- bpo-28556: Two minor fixes for ``typing`` module: allow shallow copying
  instances of generic classes, improve interaction of ``__init_subclass__``
  with generics. Original PRs by Ivan Levkivskyi.

- bpo-32214: PEP 557, Data Classes. Provides a decorator which adds
  boilerplate methods to classes which use type annotations so specify
  fields.

- bpo-27240: The header folding algorithm for the new email policies has
  been rewritten, which also fixes bpo-30788, bpo-31831, and bpo-32182.  In
  particular, RFC2231 folding is now done correctly.

- bpo-32186: io.FileIO.readall() and io.FileIO.read() now release the GIL
  when getting the file size. Fixed hang of all threads with inaccessible
  NFS server. Patch by Nir Soffer.

- bpo-321010: Add :attr:`sys.flags.dev_mode` flag

- bpo-32154: The ``asyncio.windows_utils.socketpair()`` function has been
  removed: use directly :func:`socket.socketpair` which is available on all
  platforms since Python 3.5 (before, it wasn't available on Windows).
  ``asyncio.windows_utils.socketpair()`` was just an alias to
  ``socket.socketpair`` on Python 3.5 and newer.

- bpo-32089: warnings: In development (-X dev) and debug mode (pydebug
  build), use the "default" action for ResourceWarning, rather than the
  "always" action, in the default warnings filters.

- bpo-32107: ``uuid.getnode()`` now preferentially returns universally
  administered MAC addresses if available, over locally administered MAC
  addresses.  This makes a better guarantee for global uniqueness of UUIDs
  returned from ``uuid.uuid1()``.  If only locally administered MAC
  addresses are available, the first such one found is returned.

- bpo-23033: Wildcard is now supported in hostname when it is one and only
  character in the left most segment of hostname in second argument of
  :meth:`ssl.match_hostname`.  Patch by Mandeep Singh.

- bpo-12239: Make :meth:`msilib.SummaryInformation.GetProperty` return
  ``None`` when the value of property is ``VT_EMPTY``.  Initial patch by
  Mark Mc Mahon.

- bpo-28334: Use :func:`os.path.expanduser` to find the ``~/.netrc`` file in
  :class:`netrc.netrc`.  If it does not exist, :exc:`FileNotFoundError` is
  raised.  Patch by Dimitri Merejkowsky.

- bpo-32121: Made ``tracemalloc.Traceback`` behave more like the traceback
  module, sorting the frames from oldest to most recent.
  ``Traceback.format()`` now accepts negative *limit*, truncating the result
  to the ``abs(limit)`` oldest frames. To get the old behaviour, one can use
  the new *most_recent_first* argument to ``Traceback.format()``. (Patch by
  Jesse Bakker.)

- bpo-31325: Fix wrong usage of :func:`collections.namedtuple` in the
  :meth:`RobotFileParser.parse() <urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser.parse>`
  method.

  Initial patch by Robin Wellner.

- bpo-12382: :func:`msilib.OpenDatabase` now raises a better exception
  message when it couldn't open or create an MSI file.  Initial patch by
  William Tisäter.

- bpo-19610: ``setup()`` now warns about invalid types for some fields.

  The ``distutils.dist.Distribution`` class now warns when ``classifiers``,
  ``keywords`` and ``platforms`` fields are not specified as a list or a
  string.

- bpo-32071: Added the ``-k`` command-line option to ``python -m unittest``
  to run only tests that match the given pattern(s).

- bpo-10049: Added *nullcontext* no-op context manager to contextlib. This
  provides a simpler and faster alternative to ExitStack() when handling
  optional context managers.

- bpo-28684: The new test.support.skip_unless_bind_unix_socket() decorator
  is used here to skip asyncio tests that fail because the platform lacks a
  functional bind() function for unix domain sockets (as it is the case for
  non root users on the recent Android versions that run now SELinux in
  enforcing mode).

- bpo-32110: ``codecs.StreamReader.read(n)`` now returns not more than *n*
  characters/bytes for non-negative *n*. This makes it compatible with
  ``read()`` methods of other file-like objects.

- bpo-27535: The warnings module doesn't leak memory anymore in the hidden
  warnings registry for the "ignore" action of warnings filters.
  warn_explicit() function doesn't add the warning key to the registry
  anymore for the "ignore" action.

- bpo-32088: warnings:  When Python is build is debug mode (``Py_DEBUG``),
  :exc:`DeprecationWarning`, :exc:`PendingDeprecationWarning` and
  :exc:`ImportWarning` warnings are now displayed by default.

- bpo-1647489: Fixed searching regular expression patterns that could match
  an empty string. Non-empty string can now be correctly found after
  matching an empty string.

- bpo-25054: Added support of splitting on a pattern that could match an
  empty string.

- bpo-32072: Fixed issues with binary plists:

  * Fixed saving bytearrays.
  * Identical objects will be saved only once.
  * Equal references will be load as identical objects.
  * Added support for saving and loading recursive data structures.

- bpo-32069: Drop legacy SSL transport from asyncio, ssl.MemoryBIO is always
  used anyway.

- bpo-32066: asyncio: Support pathlib.Path in create_unix_connection; sock
  arg should be optional

- bpo-32046: Updates 2to3 to convert from operator.isCallable(obj) to
  callable(obj). Patch by Dong-hee Na.

- bpo-32018: inspect.signature should follow PEP 8, if the parameter has an
  annotation and a default value. Patch by Dong-hee Na.

- bpo-32025: Add time.thread_time() and time.thread_time_ns()

- bpo-32037: Integers that fit in a signed 32-bit integer will be now
  pickled with protocol 0 using the INT opcode.  This will decrease the size
  of a pickle, speed up pickling and unpickling, and make these integers be
  unpickled as int instances in Python 2.

- bpo-32034: Make asyncio.IncompleteReadError and LimitOverrunError
  pickleable.

- bpo-32015: Fixed the looping of asyncio in the case of reconnection the
  socket during waiting async read/write from/to the socket.

- bpo-32011: Restored support of loading marshal files with the TYPE_INT64
  code. These files can be produced in Python 2.7.

- bpo-28369: Enhance add_reader/writer check that socket is not used by some
  transport. Before, only cases when add_reader/writer were called with an
  int FD were supported.  Now the check is implemented correctly for all
  file-like objects.

- bpo-31976: Fix race condition when flushing a file is slow, which can
  cause a segfault if closing the file from another thread.

- bpo-31985: Formally deprecated aifc.openfp, sunau.openfp, and wave.openfp.
  Since change 7bc817d5ba917528e8bd07ec461c635291e7b06a in 1993, openfp in
  each of the three modules had been pointing to that module's open function
  as a matter of backwards compatibility, though it had been both untested
  and undocumented.

- bpo-21862: cProfile command line now accepts `-m module_name` as an
  alternative to script path. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.

- bpo-31970: Reduce performance overhead of asyncio debug mode.

- bpo-31843: *database* argument of sqlite3.connect() now accepts a
  :term:`path-like object`, instead of just a string.

- bpo-31945: Add Configurable *blocksize* to ``HTTPConnection`` and
  ``HTTPSConnection`` for improved upload throughput.  Patch by Nir Soffer.

- bpo-31943: Add a ``cancelled()`` method to :class:`asyncio.Handle`.  Patch
  by Marat Sharafutdinov.

- bpo-9678: Fixed determining the MAC address in the uuid module:

  * Using ifconfig on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
  * Using arp on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.

  Based on patch by Takayuki Shimizukawa.

- bpo-30057: Fix potential missed signal in signal.signal().

  platforms. Patch by Jack O'Connor.

- bpo-21423: Add an initializer argument to {Process,Thread}PoolExecutor

- bpo-31927: Fixed compilation of the socket module on NetBSD 8.  Fixed
  assertion failure or reading arbitrary data when parse a AF_BLUETOOTH
  address on NetBSD and DragonFly BSD.

- bpo-27666: Fixed stack corruption in curses.box() and curses.ungetmouse()
  when the size of types chtype or mmask_t is less than the size of C long.
  curses.box() now accepts characters as arguments.  Based on patch by Steve
  Fink.

- bpo-31917: Add 3 new clock identifiers: :data:`time.CLOCK_BOOTTIME`,
  :data:`time.CLOCK_PROF` and :data:`time.CLOCK_UPTIME`.

- bpo-31897: plistlib now catches more errors when read binary plists and
  raises InvalidFileException instead of unexpected exceptions.

- bpo-25720: Fix the method for checking pad state of curses WINDOW. Patch
  by Masayuki Yamamoto.

- bpo-31893: Fixed the layout of the kqueue_event structure on OpenBSD and
  NetBSD. Fixed the comparison of the kqueue_event objects.

- bpo-31891: Fixed building the curses module on NetBSD.

- bpo-31884: added required constants to subprocess module for setting
  priority on windows

- bpo-28281: Remove year (1-9999) limits on the Calendar.weekday() function.

  Patch by Mark Gollahon.

- bpo-31702: crypt.mksalt() now allows to specify the number of rounds for
  SHA-256 and SHA-512 hashing.

- bpo-30639: :func:`inspect.getfile` no longer computes the repr of unknown
  objects to display in an error message, to protect against badly behaved
  custom reprs.

- bpo-30768: Fix the pthread+semaphore implementation of
  PyThread_acquire_lock_timed() when called with timeout > 0 and
  intr_flag=0: recompute the timeout if sem_timedwait() is interrupted by a
  signal (EINTR). See also the :pep:`475`.

- bpo-31854: Add ``mmap.ACCESS_DEFAULT`` constant.

- bpo-31834: Use optimized code for BLAKE2 only with SSSE3+. The pure SSE2
  implementation is slower than the pure C reference implementation.

- bpo-28292: Calendar.itermonthdates() will now consistently raise an
  exception when a date falls outside of the 0001-01-01 through 9999-12-31
  range.  To support applications that cannot tolerate such exceptions, the
  new methods itermonthdays3() and itermonthdays4() are added.  The new
  methods return tuples and are not restricted by the range supported by
  datetime.date.

- bpo-28564: The shutil.rmtree() function has been sped up to 20--40%. This
  was done using the os.scandir() function.

- bpo-28416: Instances of pickle.Pickler subclass with the persistent_id()
  method and pickle.Unpickler subclass with the persistent_load() method no
  longer create reference cycles.

- bpo-31653: Don't release the GIL if we can acquire a multiprocessing
  semaphore immediately.

- bpo-28326: Fix multiprocessing.Process when stdout and/or stderr is closed
  or None.

- bpo-20825: Add `subnet_of` and `superset_of` containment tests to
  :class:`ipaddress.IPv6Network` and :class:`ipaddress.IPv4Network`. Patch
  by Michel Albert and Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31827: Remove the os.stat_float_times() function. It was introduced in
  Python 2.3 for backward compatibility with Python 2.2, and was deprecated
  since Python 3.1.

- bpo-31756: Add a ``subprocess.Popen(text=False)`` keyword argument to
  `subprocess` functions to be more explicit about when the library should
  attempt to decode outputs into text. Patch by Andrew Clegg.

- bpo-31819: Add AbstractEventLoop.sock_recv_into().

- bpo-31457: If nested log adapters are used, the inner ``process()``
  methods are no longer omitted.

- bpo-31457: The ``manager`` property on LoggerAdapter objects is now
  properly settable.

- bpo-31806: Fix timeout rounding in time.sleep(), threading.Lock.acquire()
  and socket.socket.settimeout() to round correctly negative timeouts
  between -1.0 and 0.0. The functions now block waiting for events as
  expected. Previously, the call was incorrectly non-blocking. Patch by
  Pablo Galindo.

- bpo-31803: time.clock() and time.get_clock_info('clock') now emit a
  DeprecationWarning warning.

- bpo-31800: Extended support for parsing UTC offsets. strptime '%z' can now
  parse the output generated by datetime.isoformat, including seconds and
  microseconds.

- bpo-28603: traceback: Fix a TypeError that occurred during printing of
  exception tracebacks when either the current exception or an exception in
  its context/cause chain is unhashable. Patch by Zane Bitter.

- bpo-30541: Add new function to seal a mock and prevent the automatically
  creation of child mocks. Patch by Mario Corchero.

- bpo-31784: Implement the :pep:`564`, add new 6 new functions with
  nanosecond resolution to the :mod:`time` module:
  :func:`~time.clock_gettime_ns`, :func:`~time.clock_settime_ns`,
  :func:`~time.monotonic_ns`, :func:`~time.perf_counter_ns`,
  :func:`~time.process_time_ns`, :func:`~time.time_ns`.

- bpo-30143: 2to3 now generates a code that uses abstract collection classes
  from collections.abc rather than collections.

- bpo-31770: Prevent a crash when calling the ``__init__()`` method of a
  ``sqlite3.Cursor`` object more than once. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31764: Prevent a crash in ``sqlite3.Cursor.close()`` in case the
  ``Cursor`` object is uninitialized. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31752: Fix possible crash in timedelta constructor called with custom
  integers.

- bpo-31620: an empty asyncio.Queue now doesn't leak memory when queue.get
  pollers timeout

- bpo-31690: Allow the flags re.ASCII, re.LOCALE, and re.UNICODE to be used
  as group flags for regular expressions.

- bpo-30349: FutureWarning is now emitted if a regular expression contains
  character set constructs that will change semantically in the future
  (nested sets and set operations).

- bpo-31664: Added support for the Blowfish hashing in the crypt module.

- bpo-31632: Fix method set_protocol() of class _SSLProtocolTransport in
  asyncio module. This method was previously modifying a wrong reference to
  the protocol.

- bpo-15037: Added a workaround for getkey() in curses for ncurses 5.7 and
  earlier.

- bpo-31307: Allow use of bytes objects for arguments to
  :meth:`configparser.ConfigParser.read`. Patch by Vincent Michel.

- bpo-31334: Fix ``poll.poll([timeout])`` in the ``select`` module for
  arbitrary negative timeouts on all OSes where it can only be a
  non-negative integer or -1. Patch by Riccardo Coccioli.

- bpo-31310: multiprocessing's semaphore tracker should be launched again if
  crashed.

- bpo-31308: Make multiprocessing's forkserver process immune to Ctrl-C and
  other user interruptions. If it crashes, restart it when necessary.

- bpo-31245: Added support for AF_UNIX socket in asyncio
  `create_datagram_endpoint`.

- bpo-30553: Add HTTP/2 status code 421 (Misdirected Request) to
  :class:`http.HTTPStatus`. Patch by Vitor Pereira.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-32105: Added asyncio.BaseEventLoop.connect_accepted_socket
  versionadded marker.

Tests
-----

- bpo-31380: Skip test_httpservers test_undecodable_file on macOS: fails on
  APFS.

- bpo-31705: Skip test_socket.test_sha256() on Linux kernel older than 4.5.
  The test fails with ENOKEY on kernel 3.10 (on ppc64le). A fix was merged
  into the kernel 4.5.

- bpo-32138: Skip on Android test_faulthandler tests that raise SIGSEGV and
  remove the test.support.requires_android_level decorator.

- bpo-32136: The runtime embedding tests have been split out from
  ``Lib/test/test_capi.py`` into a new ``Lib/test/test_embed.py`` file.

- bpo-28668: test.support.requires_multiprocessing_queue is removed. Skip
  tests with test.support.import_module('multiprocessing.synchronize')
  instead when the semaphore implementation is broken or missing.

- bpo-32126: Skip test_get_event_loop_new_process in
  test.test_asyncio.test_events when sem_open() is not functional.

- bpo-31174: Fix test_tools.test_unparse: DirectoryTestCase now stores the
  names sample to always test the same files. It prevents false alarms when
  hunting reference leaks.

Build
-----

- bpo-28538: Revert the previous changes, the if_nameindex structure is
  defined by Unified Headers.

- bpo-28762: Revert the last commit, the F_LOCK macro is defined by Android
  Unified Headers.

- bpo-29040: Support building Android with Unified Headers. The first NDK
  release to support Unified Headers is android-ndk-r14.

- bpo-32059: ``detect_modules()`` in ``setup.py`` now also searches the
  sysroot paths when cross-compiling.

- bpo-31957: Fixes Windows SDK version detection when building for Windows.

- bpo-31609: Fixes quotes in PCbuild/clean.bat

- bpo-31934: Abort the build when building out of a not clean source tree.

- bpo-31926: Fixed Argument Clinic sometimes causing compilation errors when
  there was more than one function and/or method in a .c file with the same
  name.

- bpo-28791: Update Windows builds to use SQLite 3.21.0.

- bpo-28791: Update OS X installer to use SQLite 3.21.0.

- bpo-28643: Record profile-opt build progress with stamp files.

- bpo-31866: Finish removing support for AtheOS.

Windows
-------

- bpo-1102: Return ``None`` when ``View.Fetch()`` returns
  ``ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS`` instead of raising ``MSIError``.

  Initial patch by Anthony Tuininga.

- bpo-31944: Fixes Modify button in Apps and Features dialog.

- bpo-20486: Implement the ``Database.Close()`` method to help closing MSI
  database objects.

- bpo-31857: Make the behavior of USE_STACKCHECK deterministic in a
  multi-threaded environment.

macOS
-----

- bpo-31392: Update macOS installer to use OpenSSL 1.0.2m

IDLE
----

- bpo-32207: Improve tk event exception tracebacks in IDLE. When tk event
  handling is driven by IDLE's run loop, a confusing and distracting
  queue.EMPTY traceback context is no longer added to tk event exception
  tracebacks.  The traceback is now the same as when event handling is
  driven by user code.  Patch based on a suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-32164: Delete unused file idlelib/tabbedpages.py. Use of TabbedPageSet
  in configdialog was replaced by ttk.Notebook.

- bpo-32100: IDLE: Fix old and new bugs in pathbrowser; improve tests. Patch
  mostly by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31858: IDLE -- Restrict shell prompt manipulation to the shell. Editor
  and output windows only see an empty last prompt line.  This simplifies
  the code and fixes a minor bug when newline is inserted. Sys.ps1, if
  present, is read on Shell start-up, but is not set or changed.

- bpo-31860: The font sample in the IDLE configuration dialog is now
  editable. Changes persist while IDLE remains open

- bpo-31836: Test_code_module now passes if run after test_idle, which sets
  ps1.

  The code module uses sys.ps1 if present or sets it to '>>> ' if not.
  Test_code_module now properly tests both behaviors.  Ditto for ps2.

- bpo-28603: Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing a
  traceback that includes an exception that is unhashable. Patch by Zane
  Bitter.

- bpo-13802: Use non-Latin characters in the IDLE's Font settings sample.
  Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode
  Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a
  character. The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters a
  better idea of what they might see in IDLE's shell and editors.

  To make room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are
  re-arranged.  The Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-32159: Remove CVS and Subversion tools: remove svneol.py and
  treesync.py scripts. CPython migrated from CVS to Subversion, to
  Mercurial, and then to Git. CVS and Subversion are no longer used to
  develop CPython.

- bpo-30722: Make redemo work with Python 3.6 and newer versions.

  Also, remove the ``LOCALE`` option since it doesn't work with string
  patterns in Python 3.

  Patch by Christoph Sarnowski.

C API
-----

- bpo-20891: Fix PyGILState_Ensure(). When PyGILState_Ensure() is called in
  a non-Python thread before PyEval_InitThreads(), only call
  PyEval_InitThreads() after calling PyThreadState_New() to fix a crash.

- bpo-32125: The ``Py_UseClassExceptionsFlag`` flag has been removed. It was
  deprecated and wasn't used anymore since Python 2.0.

- bpo-25612: Move the current exception state from the frame object to the
  co-routine. This simplifies the interpreter and fixes a couple of obscure
  bugs caused by having swap exception state when entering or exiting a
  generator.

- bpo-23699: Add Py_RETURN_RICHCOMPARE macro to reduce boilerplate code in
  rich comparison functions.

- bpo-30697: The `PyExc_RecursionErrorInst` singleton is removed and
  `PyErr_NormalizeException()` does not use it anymore. This singleton is
  persistent and its members being never cleared may cause a segfault during
  finalization of the interpreter. See also issue #22898.


What's New in Python 3.7.0 alpha 2?
===================================

*Release date: 2017-10-16*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-31558: ``gc.freeze()`` is a new API that allows for moving all objects
  currently tracked by the garbage collector to a permanent generation,
  effectively removing them from future collection events. This can be used
  to protect those objects from having their PyGC_Head mutated. In effect,
  this enables great copy-on-write stability at fork().

- bpo-31642: Restored blocking "from package import module" by setting
  sys.modules["package.module"] to None.

- bpo-31708: Allow use of asynchronous generator expressions in synchronous
  functions.

- bpo-31709: Drop support of asynchronous __aiter__.

- bpo-30404: The -u option now makes the stdout and stderr streams
  unbuffered rather than line-buffered.

- bpo-31619: Fixed a ValueError when convert a string with large number of
  underscores to integer with binary base.

- bpo-31602: Fix an assertion failure in `zipimporter.get_source()` in case
  of a bad `zlib.decompress()`. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31592: Fixed an assertion failure in Python parser in case of a bad
  `unicodedata.normalize()`. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31588: Raise a `TypeError` with a helpful error message when class
  creation fails due to a metaclass with a bad ``__prepare__()`` method.
  Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31574: Importlib was instrumented with two dtrace probes to profile
  import timing.

- bpo-31566: Fix an assertion failure in `_warnings.warn()` in case of a bad
  ``__name__`` global. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31506: Improved the error message logic for object.__new__ and
  object.__init__.

- bpo-31505: Fix an assertion failure in `json`, in case
  `_json.make_encoder()` received a bad `encoder()` argument. Patch by Oren
  Milman.

- bpo-31492: Fix assertion failures in case of failing to import from a
  module with a bad ``__name__`` attribute, and in case of failing to access
  an attribute of such a module. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31478: Fix an assertion failure in `_random.Random.seed()` in case the
  argument has a bad ``__abs__()`` method. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31336: Speed up class creation by 10-20% by reducing the overhead in
  the necessary special method lookups.  Patch by Stefan Behnel.

- bpo-31415: Add ``-X importtime`` option to show how long each import
  takes. It can be used to optimize application's startup time.  Support the
  :envvar:`PYTHONPROFILEIMPORTTIME` as an equivalent way to enable this.

- bpo-31410: Optimized calling wrapper and classmethod descriptors.

- bpo-31353: :pep:`553` - Add a new built-in called ``breakpoint()`` which
  calls ``sys.breakpointhook()``.  By default this imports ``pdb`` and calls
  ``pdb.set_trace()``, but users may override ``sys.breakpointhook()`` to
  call whatever debugger they want.  The original value of the hook is saved
  in ``sys.__breakpointhook__``.

- bpo-17852: Maintain a list of open buffered files, flush them before
  exiting the interpreter.  Based on a patch from Armin Rigo.

- bpo-31315: Fix an assertion failure in imp.create_dynamic(), when
  spec.name is not a string. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31311: Fix a crash in the ``__setstate__()`` method of
  `ctypes._CData`, in case of a bad ``__dict__``. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31293: Fix crashes in true division and multiplication of a timedelta
  object by a float with a bad as_integer_ratio() method. Patch by Oren
  Milman.

- bpo-31285: Fix an assertion failure in `warnings.warn_explicit`, when the
  return value of the received loader's get_source() has a bad splitlines()
  method. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-30406: Make ``async`` and ``await`` proper keywords, as specified in
  PEP 492.

Library
-------

- bpo-30058: Fixed buffer overflow in select.kqueue.control().

- bpo-31672: ``idpattern`` in ``string.Template`` matched some non-ASCII
  characters. Now it uses ``-i`` regular expression local flag to avoid
  non-ASCII characters.

- bpo-31701: On Windows, faulthandler.enable() now ignores MSC and COM
  exceptions.

- bpo-31728: Prevent crashes in `_elementtree` due to unsafe cleanup of
  `Element.text` and `Element.tail`. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31671: Now ``re.compile()`` converts passed RegexFlag to normal int
  object before compiling. bm_regex_compile benchmark shows 14% performance
  improvements.

- bpo-30397: The types of compiled regular objects and match objects are now
  exposed as `re.Pattern` and `re.Match`.  This adds information in pydoc
  output for the re module.

- bpo-31675: Fixed memory leaks in Tkinter's methods splitlist() and split()
  when pass a string larger than 2 GiB.

- bpo-31673: Fixed typo in the name of Tkinter's method adderrorinfo().

- bpo-31648: Improvements to path predicates in ElementTree:

  * Allow whitespace around predicate parts, i.e. "[a = 'text']" instead of requiring the less readable "[a='text']".
  * Add support for text comparison of the current node, like "[.='text']".

  Patch by Stefan Behnel.

- bpo-30806: Fix the string representation of a netrc object.

- bpo-31638: Add optional argument ``compressed`` to
  ``zipapp.create_archive``, and add option ``--compress`` to the command
  line interface of ``zipapp``.

- bpo-25351: Avoid venv activate failures with undefined variables

- bpo-20519: Avoid ctypes use (if possible) and improve import time for
  uuid.

- bpo-28293: The regular expression cache is no longer completely dumped
  when it is full.

- bpo-31596: Added pthread_getcpuclockid() to the time module

- bpo-27494: Make 2to3 accept a trailing comma in generator expressions. For
  example, ``set(x for x in [],)`` is now allowed.

- bpo-30347: Stop crashes when concurrently iterate over itertools.groupby()
  iterators.

- bpo-30346: An iterator produced by itertools.groupby() iterator now
  becomes exhausted after advancing the groupby iterator.

- bpo-31556: Cancel asyncio.wait_for future faster if timeout <= 0

- bpo-31540: Allow passing a context object in
  :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` constructor. Also, free
  job resources in :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` earlier
  to improve memory usage when a worker waits for new jobs.

- bpo-31516: ``threading.current_thread()`` should not return a dummy thread
  at shutdown.

- bpo-31525: In the sqlite module, require the sqlite3_prepare_v2 API. Thus,
  the sqlite module now requires sqlite version at least 3.3.9.

- bpo-26510: argparse subparsers are now required by default.  This matches
  behaviour in Python 2. For optional subparsers, use the new parameter
  ``add_subparsers(required=False)``. Patch by Anthony Sottile. (As of
  3.7.0rc1, the default was changed to not required as had been the case
  since Python 3.3.)

- bpo-27541: Reprs of subclasses of some collection and iterator classes
  (`bytearray`, `array.array`, `collections.deque`,
  `collections.defaultdict`, `itertools.count`, `itertools.repeat`) now
  contain actual type name insteads of hardcoded name of the base class.

- bpo-31351: python -m ensurepip now exits with non-zero exit code if pip
  bootstrapping has failed.

- bpo-31389: ``pdb.set_trace()`` now takes an optional keyword-only argument
  ``header``. If given, this is printed to the console just before debugging
  begins.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-31537: Fix incorrect usage of ``get_history_length`` in readline
  documentation example code. Patch by Brad Smith.

- bpo-30085: The operator functions without double underscores are preferred
  for clarity. The one with underscores are only kept for
  back-compatibility.

Build
-----

- bpo-31696: Improve compiler version information in :data:`sys.version`
  when Python is built with Clang.

- bpo-31625: Stop using ranlib on static libraries. Instead, we assume ar
  supports the 's' flag.

- bpo-31624: Remove support for BSD/OS.

- bpo-22140: Prevent double substitution of prefix in python-config.sh.

- bpo-31569: Correct PCBuild/ case to PCbuild/ in build scripts and
  documentation.

- bpo-31536: Avoid wholesale rebuild after `make regen-all` if nothing
  changed.

IDLE
----

- bpo-31460: Simplify the API of IDLE's Module Browser.

  Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the option
  of creating a browser frame that is only part of a window.  Passing a full
  file name instead of pieces assumed to come from a .py file opens the
  possibility of browsing python files that do not end in .py.

- bpo-31649: IDLE - Make _htest, _utest parameters keyword only.

- bpo-31559: Remove test order dependence in idle_test.test_browser.

- bpo-31459: Rename IDLE's module browser from Class Browser to Module
  Browser. The original module-level class and method browser became a
  module browser, with the addition of module-level functions, years ago.
  Nested classes and functions were added yesterday.  For
  back-compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which
  appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, is not changed. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31500: Default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.

- bpo-1612262: IDLE module browser now shows nested classes and functions.
  Original patches for code and tests by Guilherme Polo and Cheryl Sabella,
  respectively.

C API
-----

- bpo-28280: Make `PyMapping_Keys()`, `PyMapping_Values()` and
  `PyMapping_Items()` always return a `list` (rather than a `list` or a
  `tuple`). Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31532: Fix memory corruption due to allocator mix in getpath.c between
  Py_GetPath() and Py_SetPath()

- bpo-25658: Implement PEP 539 for Thread Specific Storage (TSS) API: it is
  a new Thread Local Storage (TLS) API to CPython which would supersede use
  of the existing TLS API within the CPython interpreter, while deprecating
  the existing API. PEP written by Erik M. Bray, patch by Masayuki Yamamoto.


What's New in Python 3.7.0 alpha 1?
===================================

*Release date: 2017-09-19*

Security
--------

- bpo-29781: SSLObject.version() now correctly returns None when handshake
  over BIO has not been performed yet.

- bpo-29505: Add fuzz tests for float(str), int(str), unicode(str); for
  oss-fuzz.

- bpo-30947: Upgrade libexpat embedded copy from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 to
  get security fixes.

- bpo-30730: Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on
  Windows.  Prevent passing other environment variables and command
  arguments.

- bpo-30694: Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple
  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0's fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesn't
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using ``XML_SetHashSalt()``.

- bpo-30500: Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, ``splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')`` now correctly returns the
  ``127.0.0.1`` host, instead of treating ``@evil.com`` as the host in an
  authentication (``login@host``).

- bpo-29591: Update expat copy from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 to get fixes of
  CVE-2016-0718 and CVE-2016-4472. See
  https://sourceforge.net/p/expat/bugs/537/ for more information.

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-31490: Fix an assertion failure in `ctypes` class definition, in case
  the class has an attribute whose name is specified in ``_anonymous_`` but
  not in ``_fields_``. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31471: Fix an assertion failure in `subprocess.Popen()` on Windows, in
  case the env argument has a bad keys() method. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31418: Fix an assertion failure in `PyErr_WriteUnraisable()` in case
  of an exception with a bad ``__module__`` attribute. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31416: Fix assertion failures in case of a bad warnings.filters or
  warnings.defaultaction. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-28411: Change direct usage of PyInterpreterState.modules to
  PyImport_GetModuleDict(). Also introduce more uniformity in other code
  that deals with sys.modules. This helps reduce complications when working
  on sys.modules.

- bpo-28411: Switch to the abstract API when dealing with
  ``PyInterpreterState.modules``. This allows later support for all dict
  subclasses and other Mapping implementations.  Also add a
  ``PyImport_GetModule()`` function to reduce a bunch of duplicated code.

- bpo-31411: Raise a TypeError instead of SystemError in case
  warnings.onceregistry is not a dictionary. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31344: For finer control of tracing behaviour when testing the
  interpreter, two new frame attributes have been added to control the
  emission of particular trace events: ``f_trace_lines`` (``True`` by
  default) to turn off per-line trace events; and ``f_trace_opcodes``
  (``False`` by default) to turn on per-opcode trace events.

- bpo-31373: Fix several possible instances of undefined behavior due to
  floating-point demotions.

- bpo-30465: Location information (``lineno`` and ``col_offset``) in
  f-strings is now (mostly) correct.  This fixes tools like flake8 from
  showing warnings on the wrong line (typically the first line of the file).

- bpo-30860: Consolidate CPython's global runtime state under a single
  struct.  This improves discoverability of the runtime state.

- bpo-31347: Fix possible undefined behavior in _PyObject_FastCall_Prepend.

- bpo-31343: Include sys/sysmacros.h for major(), minor(), and makedev().
  GNU C libray plans to remove the functions from sys/types.h.

- bpo-31291: Fix an assertion failure in `zipimport.zipimporter.get_data` on
  Windows, when the return value of ``pathname.replace('/','\\')`` isn't a
  string. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31271: Fix an assertion failure in the write() method of
  `io.TextIOWrapper`, when the encoder doesn't return a bytes object. Patch
  by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31243: Fix a crash in some methods of `io.TextIOWrapper`, when the
  decoder's state is invalid. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-30721: ``print`` now shows correct usage hint for using Python 2
  redirection syntax.  Patch by Sanyam Khurana.

- bpo-31070: Fix a race condition in importlib _get_module_lock().

- bpo-30747: Add a non-dummy implementation of _Py_atomic_store and
  _Py_atomic_load on MSVC.

- bpo-31095: Fix potential crash during GC caused by ``tp_dealloc`` which
  doesn't call ``PyObject_GC_UnTrack()``.

- bpo-31071: Avoid masking original TypeError in call with * unpacking when
  other arguments are passed.

- bpo-30978: str.format_map() now passes key lookup exceptions through.
  Previously any exception was replaced with a KeyError exception.

- bpo-30808: Use _Py_atomic API for concurrency-sensitive signal state.

- bpo-30876: Relative import from unloaded package now reimports the package
  instead of failing with SystemError.  Relative import from non-package now
  fails with ImportError rather than SystemError.

- bpo-30703: Improve signal delivery.

  Avoid using Py_AddPendingCall from signal handler, to avoid calling
  signal-unsafe functions. The tests I'm adding here fail without the rest
  of the patch, on Linux and OS X. This means our signal delivery logic had
  defects (some signals could be lost).

- bpo-30765: Avoid blocking in pthread_mutex_lock() when
  PyThread_acquire_lock() is asked not to block.

- bpo-31161: Make sure the 'Missing parentheses' syntax error message is
  only applied to SyntaxError, not to subclasses. Patch by Martijn Pieters.

- bpo-30814: Fixed a race condition when import a submodule from a package.

- bpo-30736: The internal unicodedata database has been upgraded to Unicode
  10.0.

- bpo-30604: Move co_extra_freefuncs from per-thread to per-interpreter to
  avoid crashes.

- bpo-30597: ``print`` now shows expected input in custom error message when
  used as a Python 2 statement. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.

- bpo-30682: Removed a too-strict assertion that failed for certain
  f-strings, such as eval("f'\\\n'") and eval("f'\\\r'").

- bpo-30501: The compiler now produces more optimal code for complex
  condition expressions in the "if", "while" and "assert" statement, the
  "if" expression, and generator expressions and comprehensions.

- bpo-28180: Implement PEP 538 (legacy C locale coercion). This means that
  when a suitable coercion target locale is available, both the core
  interpreter and locale-aware C extensions will assume the use of UTF-8 as
  the default text encoding, rather than ASCII.

- bpo-30486: Allows setting cell values for __closure__. Patch by Lisa
  Roach.

- bpo-30537: itertools.islice now accepts integer-like objects (having an
  __index__ method) as start, stop, and slice arguments

- bpo-25324: Tokens needed for parsing in Python moved to C. ``COMMENT``,
  ``NL`` and ``ENCODING``. This way the tokens and tok_names in the token
  module don't get changed when you import the tokenize module.

- bpo-29104: Fixed parsing backslashes in f-strings.

- bpo-27945: Fixed various segfaults with dict when input collections are
  mutated during searching, inserting or comparing.  Based on patches by
  Duane Griffin and Tim Mitchell.

- bpo-25794: Fixed type.__setattr__() and type.__delattr__() for
  non-interned attribute names.  Based on patch by Eryk Sun.

- bpo-30039: If a KeyboardInterrupt happens when the interpreter is in the
  middle of resuming a chain of nested 'yield from' or 'await' calls, it's
  now correctly delivered to the innermost frame.

- bpo-28974: ``object.__format__(x, '')`` is now equivalent to ``str(x)``
  rather than ``format(str(self), '')``.

- bpo-30024: Circular imports involving absolute imports with binding a
  submodule to a name are now supported.

- bpo-12414: sys.getsizeof() on a code object now returns the sizes which
  includes the code struct and sizes of objects which it references. Patch
  by Dong-hee Na.

- bpo-29839: len() now raises ValueError rather than OverflowError if
  __len__() returned a large negative integer.

- bpo-11913: README.rst is now included in the list of distutils standard
  READMEs and therefore included in source distributions.

- bpo-29914: Fixed default implementations of __reduce__ and
  __reduce_ex__(). object.__reduce__() no longer takes arguments,
  object.__reduce_ex__() now requires one argument.

- bpo-29949: Fix memory usage regression of set and frozenset object.

- bpo-29935: Fixed error messages in the index() method of tuple, list and
  deque when pass indices of wrong type.

- bpo-29816: Shift operation now has less opportunity to raise
  OverflowError. ValueError always is raised rather than OverflowError for
  negative counts. Shifting zero with non-negative count always returns
  zero.

- bpo-24821: Fixed the slowing down to 25 times in the searching of some
  unlucky Unicode characters.

- bpo-29102: Add a unique ID to PyInterpreterState.  This makes it easier to
  identify each subinterpreter.

- bpo-29894: The deprecation warning is emitted if __complex__ returns an
  instance of a strict subclass of complex.  In a future versions of Python
  this can be an error.

- bpo-29859: Show correct error messages when any of the pthread_* calls in
  thread_pthread.h fails.

- bpo-29849: Fix a memory leak when an ImportError is raised during from
  import.

- bpo-28856: Fix an oversight that %b format for bytes should support
  objects follow the buffer protocol.

- bpo-29723: The ``sys.path[0]`` initialization change for bpo-29139 caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing ``__main__`` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import
  location's parent directory to ``sys.path``, and ensures no other
  ``sys.path`` entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import
  location named on the command line.

- bpo-29568: Escaped percent "%%" in the format string for classic string
  formatting no longer allows any characters between two percents.

- bpo-29714: Fix a regression that bytes format may fail when containing
  zero bytes inside.

- bpo-29695: bool(), float(), list() and tuple() no longer take keyword
  arguments. The first argument of int() can now be passes only as
  positional argument.

- bpo-28893: Set correct __cause__ for errors about invalid awaitables
  returned from __aiter__ and __anext__.

- bpo-28876: ``bool(range)`` works even if ``len(range)`` raises
  :exc:`OverflowError`.

- bpo-29683: Fixes to memory allocation in _PyCode_SetExtra.  Patch by Brian
  Coleman.

- bpo-29684: Fix minor regression of PyEval_CallObjectWithKeywords. It
  should raise TypeError when kwargs is not a dict.  But it might cause segv
  when args=NULL and kwargs is not a dict.

- bpo-28598: Support __rmod__ for subclasses of str being called before
  str.__mod__. Patch by Martijn Pieters.

- bpo-29607: Fix stack_effect computation for CALL_FUNCTION_EX. Patch by
  Matthieu Dartiailh.

- bpo-29602: Fix incorrect handling of signed zeros in complex constructor
  for complex subclasses and for inputs having a __complex__ method. Patch
  by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-29347: Fixed possibly dereferencing undefined pointers when creating
  weakref objects.

- bpo-29463: Add ``docstring`` field to Module, ClassDef, FunctionDef, and
  AsyncFunctionDef ast nodes.  docstring is not first stmt in their body
  anymore.  It affects ``co_firstlineno`` and ``co_lnotab`` of code object
  for module and class. (Reverted in :issue:`32911`.)

- bpo-29438: Fixed use-after-free problem in key sharing dict.

- bpo-29546: Set the 'path' and 'name' attribute on ImportError for ``from
  ... import ...``.

- bpo-29546: Improve from-import error message with location

- bpo-29478: If max_line_length=None is specified while using the Compat32
  policy, it is no longer ignored.  Patch by Mircea Cosbuc.

- bpo-29319: Prevent RunMainFromImporter overwriting sys.path[0].

- bpo-29337: Fixed possible BytesWarning when compare the code objects.
  Warnings could be emitted at compile time.

- bpo-29327: Fixed a crash when pass the iterable keyword argument to
  sorted().

- bpo-29034: Fix memory leak and use-after-free in os module
  (path_converter).

- bpo-29159: Fix regression in bytes(x) when x.__index__() raises Exception.

- bpo-29049: Call _PyObject_GC_TRACK() lazily when calling Python function.
  Calling function is up to 5% faster.

- bpo-28927: bytes.fromhex() and bytearray.fromhex() now ignore all ASCII
  whitespace, not only spaces.  Patch by Robert Xiao.

- bpo-28932: Do not include <sys/random.h> if it does not exist.

- bpo-25677: Correct the positioning of the syntax error caret for indented
  blocks. Based on patch by Michael Layzell.

- bpo-29000: Fixed bytes formatting of octals with zero padding in alternate
  form.

- bpo-18896: Python function can now have more than 255 parameters.
  collections.namedtuple() now supports tuples with more than 255 elements.

- bpo-28596: The preferred encoding is UTF-8 on Android. Patch written by
  Chi Hsuan Yen.

- bpo-22257: Clean up interpreter startup (see PEP 432).

- bpo-26919: On Android, operating system data is now always encoded/decoded
  to/from UTF-8, instead of the locale encoding to avoid inconsistencies
  with os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() which are already using UTF-8.

- bpo-28991: functools.lru_cache() was susceptible to an obscure reentrancy
  bug triggerable by a monkey-patched len() function.

- bpo-28147: Fix a memory leak in split-table dictionaries: setattr() must
  not convert combined table into split table. Patch written by INADA Naoki.

- bpo-28739: f-string expressions are no longer accepted as docstrings and
  by ast.literal_eval() even if they do not include expressions.

- bpo-28512: Fixed setting the offset attribute of SyntaxError by
  PyErr_SyntaxLocationEx() and PyErr_SyntaxLocationObject().

- bpo-28918: Fix the cross compilation of xxlimited when Python has been
  built with Py_DEBUG defined.

- bpo-23722: Rather than silently producing a class that doesn't support
  zero-argument ``super()`` in methods, failing to pass the new
  ``__classcell__`` namespace entry up to ``type.__new__`` now results in a
  ``DeprecationWarning`` and a class that supports zero-argument
  ``super()``.

- bpo-28797: Modifying the class __dict__ inside the __set_name__ method of
  a descriptor that is used inside that class no longer prevents calling the
  __set_name__ method of other descriptors.

- bpo-28799: Remove the ``PyEval_GetCallStats()`` function and deprecate the
  untested and undocumented ``sys.callstats()`` function. Remove the
  ``CALL_PROFILE`` special build: use the :func:`sys.setprofile` function,
  :mod:`cProfile` or :mod:`profile` to profile function calls.

- bpo-12844: More than 255 arguments can now be passed to a function.

- bpo-28782: Fix a bug in the implementation ``yield from`` when checking if
  the next instruction is YIELD_FROM. Regression introduced by WORDCODE
  (issue #26647).

- bpo-28774: Fix error position of the unicode error in ASCII and Latin1
  encoders when a string returned by the error handler contains multiple
  non-encodable characters (non-ASCII for the ASCII codec, characters out of
  the U+0000-U+00FF range for Latin1).

- bpo-28731: Optimize _PyDict_NewPresized() to create correct size dict.
  Improve speed of dict literal with constant keys up to 30%.

- bpo-28532: Show sys.version when -V option is supplied twice.

- bpo-27100: The with-statement now checks for __enter__ before it checks
  for __exit__. This gives less confusing error messages when both methods
  are missing. Patch by Jonathan Ellington.

- bpo-28746: Fix the set_inheritable() file descriptor method on platforms
  that do not have the ioctl FIOCLEX and FIONCLEX commands.

- bpo-26920: Fix not getting the locale's charset upon initializing the
  interpreter, on platforms that do not have langinfo.

- bpo-28648: Fixed crash in Py_DecodeLocale() in debug build on Mac OS X
  when decode astral characters.  Patch by Xiang Zhang.

  implementation.  Patch by Adrian Wielgosik.

- bpo-28580: Optimize iterating split table values. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-28583: PyDict_SetDefault didn't combine split table when needed. Patch
  by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-28128: Deprecation warning for invalid str and byte escape sequences
  now prints better information about where the error occurs. Patch by
  Serhiy Storchaka and Eric Smith.

  loss in PyTraceBack_Here().

- bpo-28183: Optimize and cleanup dict iteration.

- bpo-26081: Added C implementation of asyncio.Future. Original patch by
  Yury Selivanov.

- bpo-28379: Added sanity checks and tests for PyUnicode_CopyCharacters().
  Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-28376: The type of long range iterator is now registered as Iterator.
  Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-28376: Creating instances of range_iterator by calling range_iterator
  type now is disallowed.  Calling iter() on range instance is the only way.
  Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-26906: Resolving special methods of uninitialized type now causes
  implicit initialization of the type instead of a fail.

- bpo-18287: PyType_Ready() now checks that tp_name is not NULL. Original
  patch by Niklas Koep.

- bpo-24098: Fixed possible crash when AST is changed in process of
  compiling it.

- bpo-28201: Dict reduces possibility of 2nd conflict in hash table when
  hashes have same lower bits.

- bpo-28350: String constants with null character no longer interned.

- bpo-26617: Fix crash when GC runs during weakref callbacks.

- bpo-27942: String constants now interned recursively in tuples and
  frozensets.

- bpo-28289: ImportError.__init__ now resets not specified attributes.

- bpo-21578: Fixed misleading error message when ImportError called with
  invalid keyword args.

- bpo-28203: Fix incorrect type in complex(1.0, {2:3}) error message. Patch
  by Soumya Sharma.

- bpo-28086: Single var-positional argument of tuple subtype was passed
  unscathed to the C-defined function.  Now it is converted to exact tuple.

- bpo-28214: Now __set_name__ is looked up on the class instead of the
  instance.

- bpo-27955: Fallback on reading /dev/urandom device when the getrandom()
  syscall fails with EPERM, for example when blocked by SECCOMP.

- bpo-31499: xml.etree: Fix a crash when a parser is part of a reference
  cycle.

- bpo-31482: ``random.seed()`` now works with bytes in version=1

- bpo-28556: typing.get_type_hints now finds the right globalns for classes
  and modules by default (when no ``globalns`` was specified by the caller).

- bpo-28556: Speed improvements to the ``typing`` module.  Original PRs by
  Ivan Levkivskyi and Mitar.

- bpo-31544: The C accelerator module of ElementTree ignored exceptions

  threads to wait until all these threads complete in server_close().

- bpo-28638: Changed the implementation strategy for
  collections.namedtuple() to substantially reduce the use of exec() in
  favor of precomputed methods. As a result, the *verbose* parameter and
  *_source* attribute are no longer supported.  The benefits include 1)
  having a smaller memory footprint for applications using multiple named
  tuples, 2) faster creation of the named tuple class (approx 4x to 6x
  depending on how it is measured), and 3) minor speed-ups for instance
  creation using __new__, _make, and _replace.  (The primary patch
  contributor is Jelle Zijlstra with further improvements by INADA Naoki,
  Serhiy Storchaka, and Raymond Hettinger.)

  https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/115

- bpo-29136: Add TLS 1.3 cipher suites and OP_NO_TLSv1_3.

- bpo-1198569: ``string.Template`` subclasses can optionally define
  ``braceidpattern`` if they want to specify different placeholder patterns
  inside and outside the braces.  If None (the default) it falls back to
  ``idpattern``.

- bpo-31326: concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor.shutdown() now
  explicitly closes the call queue. Moreover, shutdown(wait=True) now also
  join the call queue thread, to prevent leaking a dangling thread.

  not being found.

- bpo-29741: Update some methods in the _pyio module to also accept integer
  types. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31249: concurrent.futures: WorkItem.run() used by ThreadPoolExecutor
  now breaks a reference cycle between an exception object and the WorkItem
  object.

- bpo-31247: xmlrpc.server now explicitly breaks reference cycles when using
  sys.exc_info() in code handling exceptions.

- bpo-23835: configparser: reading defaults in the ``ConfigParser()``
  constructor is now using ``read_dict()``, making its behavior consistent
  with the rest of the parser.  Non-string keys and values in the defaults
  dictionary are now being implicitly converted to strings.  Patch by James
  Tocknell.

- bpo-31238: pydoc: the stop() method of the private ServerThread class now
  waits until DocServer.serve_until_quit() completes and then explicitly
  sets its docserver attribute to None to break a reference cycle.

  some error types have been changed to more specific ones.

- bpo-31109: Convert zipimport to use Argument Clinic.

- bpo-30102: The ssl and hashlib modules now call
  OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms_noconf() on OpenSSL < 1.1.0. The function
  detects CPU features and enables optimizations on some CPU architectures
  such as POWER8. Patch is based on research from Gustavo Serra Scalet.

- bpo-18966: Non-daemonic threads created by a multiprocessing.Process are
  now joined on child exit.

- bpo-31183: `dis` now works with asynchronous generator and coroutine
  objects. Patch by George Collins based on diagnosis by Luciano Ramalho.

- bpo-5001: There are a number of uninformative asserts in the
  `multiprocessing` module, as noted in issue 5001. This change fixes two of
  the most potentially problematic ones, since they are in error-reporting
  code, in the `multiprocessing.managers.convert_to_error` function. (It
  also makes more informative a ValueError message.) The only potentially
  problematic change is that the AssertionError is now a TypeError; however,
  this should also help distinguish it from an AssertionError being
  *reported* by the function/its caller (such as in issue 31169). - Patch by
  Allen W. Smith (drallensmith on github).

- bpo-31185: Fixed miscellaneous errors in asyncio speedup module.

- bpo-31151: socketserver.ForkingMixIn.server_close() now waits until all
  child processes completed to prevent leaking zombie processes.

  faster when comparing arrays holding values of the same integer type.

- bpo-31135: ttk: fix the destroy() method of LabeledScale and OptionMenu
  classes. Call the parent destroy() method even if the used attribute
  doesn't exist. The LabeledScale.destroy() method now also explicitly
  clears label and scale attributes to help the garbage collector to destroy
  all widgets.

- bpo-31107: Fix `copyreg._slotnames()` mangled attribute calculation for
  classes whose name begins with an underscore. Patch by Shane Harvey.

  actual files. Try to be careful to do as little disk I/O as possible.

- bpo-26732: Fix too many fds in processes started with the "forkserver"
  method.

  A child process would inherit as many fds as the number of still-running
  children.

- bpo-30807: signal.setitimer() may disable the timer when passed a tiny
  value.

  Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(),
  which is specified as taking microsecond-resolution intervals. However, on
  some platform, our conversion routine could convert 1e-6 into a zero
  interval, therefore disabling the timer instead of (re-)scheduling it.

- bpo-30441: Fix bug when modifying os.environ while iterating over it

- bpo-29585: Avoid importing ``sysconfig`` from ``site`` to improve startup
  speed. Python startup is about 5% faster on Linux and 30% faster on macOS.

- bpo-29293: Add missing parameter "n" on

  is now required when building _ctypes on such platforms.

- bpo-15819: Remove redundant include search directory option for building
  outside the source tree.

- bpo-28676: Prevent missing 'getentropy' declaration warning on macOS.

IDLE
----

- bpo-31493: IDLE code context -- fix code update and font update timers.

  Canceling timers prevents a warning message when test_idle completes.

- bpo-31488: IDLE - Update non-key options in former extension classes. When
  applying configdialog changes, call .reload for each feature class. Change
  ParenMatch so updated options affect existing instances attached to
  existing editor windows.

- bpo-31477: IDLE - Improve rstrip entry in doc. Strip trailing whitespace
  strips more than blank spaces.  Multiline string literals are not skipped.

- bpo-31480: IDLE - make tests pass with zzdummy extension disabled by
  default.

- bpo-31421: Document how IDLE runs tkinter programs. IDLE calls tcl/tk
  update in the background in order to make live

  interaction and experimentation with tkinter applications much easier.

- bpo-31414: IDLE -- fix tk entry box tests by deleting first. Adding to an
  int entry is not the same as deleting and inserting because int('') will
  fail.

- bpo-31051: Rearrange IDLE configdialog GenPage into Window, Editor, and
  Help sections.

- bpo-30617: IDLE - Add docstrings and tests for outwin subclass of editor.

  Move some data and functions from the class to module level. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31287: IDLE - Do not modify tkinter.message in test_configdialog.

- bpo-27099: Convert IDLE's built-in 'extensions' to regular features.

  About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions.
  Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not
  good for maintenance.  Hence the conversion.

  The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings for
  builtin features are now handled uniformly.  Now, editing a binding in a
  keyset only affects its value in the keyset.  All bindings are defined
  together in the system-specific default keysets in config-extensions.def.
  All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-extension.cfg.  All take
  effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok.

  The affected events are '<<force-open-completions>>', '<<expand-word>>',
  '<<force-open-calltip>>', '<<flash-paren>>', '<<format-paragraph>>',
  '<<run-module>>', '<<check-module>>', and '<<zoom-height>>'.  Any (global)
  customizations made before 3.6.3 will not affect their keyset-specific
  customization after 3.6.3. and vice versa.

  Initial patch by Charles Wohlganger.

  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31001: Add tests for configdialog highlight tab.  Patch by Cheryl
  Sabella.

  Victor Stinner.

- bpo-31002: Add tests for configdialog keys tab. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-19903: IDLE: Calltips use `inspect.signature` instead of
  `inspect.getfullargspec`. This improves calltips for builtins converted to
  use Argument Clinic. Patch by Louie Lu.

- bpo-31083: IDLE - Add an outline of a TabPage class in configdialog.
  Update existing classes to match outline. Initial patch by Cheryl Sabella.

  Reedy and Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31060: IDLE - Finish rearranging methods of ConfigDialog Grouping
  methods pertaining to each tab and the buttons will aid writing tests and
  improving the tabs and will enable splitting the groups into classes.

- bpo-30853: IDLE -- Factor a VarTrace class out of ConfigDialog.

  Instance tracers manages pairs consisting of a tk variable and a callback
  function.  When tracing is turned on, setting the variable calls the
  function.  Test coverage for the new class is 100%.

- bpo-31003: IDLE: Add more tests for General tab.

- bpo-30993: IDLE - Improve configdialog font page and tests.

  In configdialog: Document causal pathways in create_font_tab docstring.
  Simplify some attribute names. Move set_samples calls to var_changed_font
  (idea from Cheryl Sabella).  Move related functions to positions after the
  create widgets function.

  In test_configdialog: Fix test_font_set so not order dependent.  Fix
  renamed test_indent_scale so it tests the widget.  Adjust tests for
  movement of set_samples call.  Add tests for load functions.  Put all font
  tests in one class and tab indent tests in another.  Except for two lines,
  these tests completely cover the related functions.

- bpo-30981: IDLE -- Add more configdialog font page tests.

- bpo-28523: IDLE: replace 'colour' with 'color' in configdialog.

- bpo-30917: Add tests for idlelib.config.IdleConf. Increase coverage from
  46% to 96%. Patch by Louie Lu.

  duplicate, one is set but cannot be altered by users. Patch by Cheryl
  Sabella.

- bpo-30870: IDLE: In Settings dialog, select font with Up, Down keys as
  well as mouse. Initial patch by Louie Lu.

- bpo-8231: IDLE: call config.IdleConf.GetUserCfgDir only once.

- bpo-30779: IDLE: Factor ConfigChanges class from configdialog, put in
  config; test. * In config, put dump test code in a function; run it and
  unittest in   'if __name__ == '__main__'. * Add class config.ConfigChanges
  based on changes_class_v4.py on bpo issue. * Add class
  test_config.ChangesTest, partly using configdialog_tests_v1.py. * Revise
  configdialog to use ConfigChanges; see tracker msg297804. * Revise
  test_configdialog to match configdialog changes. * Remove configdialog
  functions unused or moved to ConfigChanges. Cheryl Sabella contributed
  parts of the patch.

- bpo-30777: IDLE: configdialog - Add docstrings and fix comments. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-30495: IDLE: Improve textview with docstrings, PEP8 names, and more
  tests. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-30723: IDLE: Make several improvements to parenmatch. Add 'parens'
  style to highlight both opener and closer. Make 'default' style, which is
  not default, a synonym for 'opener'. Make time-delay work the same with
  all styles. Add help for config dialog extensions tab, including help for
  parenmatch. Add new tests.  Original patch by Charles Wohlganger.

- bpo-30674: IDLE: add docstrings to grep module. Patch by Cheryl Sabella

- bpo-21519: IDLE's basic custom key entry dialog now detects duplicates
  properly. Original patch by Saimadhav Heblikar.

- bpo-29910: IDLE no longer deletes a character after commenting out a
  region by a key shortcut.  Add ``return 'break'`` for this and other
  potential conflicts between IDLE and default key bindings.

- bpo-30728: Review and change idlelib.configdialog names. Lowercase method
  and attribute names. Replace 'colour' with 'color', expand overly cryptic
  names, delete unneeded underscores. Replace ``import *`` with specific
  imports. Patches by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-6739: IDLE: Verify user-entered key sequences by trying to bind them
  with tk. Add tests for all 3 validation functions. Original patch by G
  Polo.  Tests added by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-15786: Fix several problems with IDLE's autocompletion box. The
  following should now work: clicking on selection box items; using the
  scrollbar; selecting an item by hitting Return. Hangs on MacOSX should no
  longer happen. Patch by Louie Lu.

- bpo-25514: Add doc subsubsection about IDLE failure to start. Popup
  no-connection message directs users to this section.

  100%. Patches by Louie Lu, Cheryl Sabella, and Terry Jan Reedy.

- bpo-30303: Add _utest option to textview; add new tests. Increase coverage
  to 100%. Patches by Louie Lu and Terry Jan Reedy.

- bpo-28572: Add 10% to coverage of IDLE's test_configdialog. Update and
  augment description of the configuration system.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-30983: gdb integration commands (py-bt, etc.) work on optimized shared
  builds now, too.  PEP 523 introduced _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault which
  inlines PyEval_EvalFrameEx on non-debug shared builds.  This broke the
  ability to use py-bt, py-up, and a few other Python-specific gdb
  integrations. The problem is fixed by only looking for
  _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault frames in python-gdb.py.  Original patch by Bruno
  "Polaco" Penteado.

- bpo-29748: Added the slice index converter in Argument Clinic.

- bpo-24037: Argument Clinic now uses the converter `bool(accept={int})`
  rather than `int` for semantical booleans.  This avoids repeating the
  default value for Python and C and will help in converting to `bool` in
  future.

- bpo-29367: python-gdb.py now supports also ``method-wrapper``
  (``wrapperobject``) objects.

- bpo-28023: Fix python-gdb.py didn't support new dict implementation.

  Tools. Please use the new Python benchmark suite
  https://github.com/python/performance which is more reliable and includes
  a portable version of pybench working on Python 2 and Python 3.

- bpo-28102: The zipfile module CLI now prints usage to stderr. Patch by
  Stephen J. Turnbull.

C API
-----

- bpo-31338: Added the ``Py_UNREACHABLE()`` macro for code paths which are
  never expected to be reached.  This and a few other useful macros are now
  documented in the C API manual.

- bpo-30832: Remove own implementation for thread-local storage.

  CPython has provided the own implementation for thread-local storage (TLS)
  on Python/thread.c, it's used in the case which a platform has not
  supplied native TLS.  However, currently all supported platforms (Windows
  and pthreads) have provided native TLS and defined the Py_HAVE_NATIVE_TLS
  macro with unconditional in any case.

- bpo-30708: PyUnicode_AsWideCharString() now raises a ValueError if the
  second argument is NULL and the wchar_t\* string contains null characters.

- bpo-16500: Deprecate PyOS_AfterFork() and add PyOS_BeforeFork(),
  PyOS_AfterFork_Parent() and PyOS_AfterFork_Child().

- bpo-6532: The type of results of PyThread_start_new_thread() and
  PyThread_get_thread_ident(), and the id parameter of
  PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc() changed from "long" to "unsigned long".

- bpo-27867: Function PySlice_GetIndicesEx() is deprecated and replaced with
  a macro if Py_LIMITED_API is not set or set to the value between
  0x03050400 and 0x03060000 (not including) or 0x03060100 or higher.  Added
  functions PySlice_Unpack() and PySlice_AdjustIndices().

- bpo-29083: Fixed the declaration of some public API functions.
  PyArg_VaParse() and PyArg_VaParseTupleAndKeywords() were not available in
  limited API. PyArg_ValidateKeywordArguments(), PyArg_UnpackTuple() and
  Py_BuildValue() were not available in limited API of version < 3.3 when
  PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN is defined.

- bpo-28769: The result of PyUnicode_AsUTF8AndSize() and PyUnicode_AsUTF8()
  is now of type ``const char *`` rather of ``char *``.

- bpo-29058: All stable API extensions added after Python 3.2 are now
  available only when Py_LIMITED_API is set to the PY_VERSION_HEX value of
  the minimum Python version supporting this API.

- bpo-28822: The index parameters *start* and *end* of PyUnicode_FindChar()
  are now adjusted to behave like ``str[start:end]``.

- bpo-28808: PyUnicode_CompareWithASCIIString() now never raises exceptions.

- bpo-28761: The fields name and doc of structures PyMemberDef, PyGetSetDef,
  PyStructSequence_Field, PyStructSequence_Desc, and wrapperbase are now of
  type ``const char *`` rather of ``char *``.

- bpo-28748: Private variable _Py_PackageContext is now of type ``const char
  *`` rather of ``char *``.

- bpo-19569: Compiler warnings are now emitted if use most of deprecated
  functions.

- bpo-28426: Deprecated undocumented functions PyUnicode_AsEncodedObject(),
  PyUnicode_AsDecodedObject(), PyUnicode_AsDecodedUnicode() and
  PyUnicode_AsEncodedUnicode().

Tests
-----

- bpo-33655: Ignore test_posix_fallocate failures on BSD platforms that
  might be due to running on ZFS.

- bpo-19417: Add test_bdb.py.

Build
-----

- bpo-5755: Move ``-Wstrict-prototypes`` option to ``CFLAGS_NODIST`` from

Windows
-------

- bpo-33184: Update Windows installer to OpenSSL 1.0.2o.

macOS
-----

- bpo-33184: Update macOS installer build to use OpenSSL 1.0.2o.

IDLE
----

- bpo-33656: On Windows, add API call saying that tk scales for DPI. On
  Windows 8.1+ or 10, with DPI compatibility properties of the Python binary
  unchanged, and a monitor resolution greater than 96 DPI, this should make
  text and lines sharper.  It should otherwise have no effect.

- bpo-33768: Clicking on a context line moves that line to the top of the
  editor window.

- bpo-33763: IDLE: Use read-only text widget for code context instead of
  label widget.

- bpo-33664: Scroll IDLE editor text by lines. Previously, the mouse wheel
  and scrollbar slider moved text by a fixed number of pixels, resulting in
  partial lines at the top of the editor box.  The change also applies to
  the shell and grep output windows, but not to read-only text views.

- bpo-33679: Enable theme-specific color configuration for Code Context. Use
  the Highlights tab to see the setting for built-in themes or add settings
  to custom themes.

  or longer than 1 byte, and the ``LC_NUMERIC`` locale is different than the
  ``LC_CTYPE`` locale. This temporary change affects other threads.

  Same change for the :meth:`str.format` method when formatting a number
  (:class:`int`, :class:`float`, :class:`float` and subclasses) with the
  ``n`` type (ex: ``'{:n}'.format(1234)``).

  each function. Patch by Pablo Galindo Salgado.

Tests
-----

- bpo-32517: Fix failing ``test_asyncio`` on macOS 10.12.2+ due to transport
  of ``KqueueSelector`` loop was not being closed.

- bpo-32721: Fix test_hashlib to not fail if the _md5 module is not built.

  SSLv23_METHOD(). Change TLS/SSL protocol of some tests to PROTOCOL_TLS or
  PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2 to make them pass on Debian.

Build
-----

- bpo-32635: Fix segfault of the crypt module when libxcrypt is provided
  instead of libcrypt at the system.

Windows
-------

macOS
-----

- bpo-32726: Provide an additional, more modern macOS installer variant that
  supports macOS 10.9+ systems in 64-bit mode only. Upgrade the supplied
  third-party libraries to OpenSSL 1.0.2n, XZ 5.2.3, and SQLite 3.22.0. The
  10.9+ installer now links with and supplies its own copy of Tcl/Tk 8.6.8.

IDLE
----

- bpo-32984: Set ``__file__`` while running a startup file.  Like Python,
  IDLE optionally runs one startup file in the Shell window before
  presenting the first interactive input prompt.  For IDLE, ``-s`` runs a
  file named in environmental variable  :envvar:`IDLESTARTUP` or
  :envvar:`PYTHONSTARTUP`; ``-r file`` runs ``file``.  Python sets
  ``__file__`` to the startup file name before running the file and unsets
  it before the first prompt.  IDLE now does the same when run normally,
  without the ``-n`` option.

- bpo-32940: Simplify and rename StringTranslatePseudoMapping in pyparse.

- bpo-32916: Change ``str`` to ``code`` in pyparse.

- bpo-32905: Remove unused code in pyparse module.

- bpo-32874: Add tests for pyparse.

- bpo-32837: Using the system and place-dependent default encoding for
  open() is a bad idea for IDLE's system and location-independent files.

- bpo-32826: Add "encoding=utf-8" to open() in IDLE's test_help_about. GUI
  test test_file_buttons() only looks at initial ascii-only lines, but
  failed on systems where open() defaults to 'ascii' because readline()
  internally reads and decodes far enough ahead to encounter a non-ascii
  character in CREDITS.txt.

- bpo-32765: Update configdialog General tab docstring to add new widgets to
  the widget list.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-24960: 2to3 and lib2to3 can now read pickled grammar files using
  pkgutil.get_data() rather than probing the filesystem. This lets 2to3 and
  lib2to3 work when run from a zipfile.

- bpo-32222: Fix pygettext not extracting docstrings for functions with type
  annotated arguments. Patch by Toby Harradine.

C API
-----

- bpo-29084: Undocumented C API for OrderedDict has been excluded from the
  limited C API. It was added by mistake and actually never worked in the
  limited C API.

  spec.name is not a string. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31311: Fix a crash in the ``__setstate__()`` method of
  `ctypes._CData`, in case of a bad ``__dict__``. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31705: Skip test_socket.test_sha256() on Linux kernel older than 4.5.
  The test fails with ENOKEY on kernel 3.10 (on ppc64le). A fix was merged
  into the kernel 4.5.

- bpo-31174: Fix test_tools.test_unparse: DirectoryTestCase now stores the
  names sample to always test the same files. It prevents false alarms when
  hunting reference leaks.

- bpo-30695: Add the `set_nomemory(start, stop)` and `remove_mem_hooks()`
  functions to the _testcapi module.

Build
-----

- bpo-32059: ``detect_modules()`` in ``setup.py`` now also searches the
  sysroot paths when cross-compiling.

- bpo-31957: Fixes Windows SDK version detection when building for Windows.

- bpo-31609: Fixes quotes in PCbuild/clean.bat

- bpo-31934: Abort the build when building out of a not clean source tree.

- bpo-31926: Fixed Argument Clinic sometimes causing compilation errors when
  there was more than one function and/or method in a .c file with the same
  name.

- bpo-28791: Update Windows builds to use SQLite 3.21.0.

- bpo-28791: Update OS X installer to use SQLite 3.21.0.

- bpo-22140: Prevent double substitution of prefix in python-config.sh.

- bpo-31536: Avoid wholesale rebuild after `make regen-all` if nothing
  changed.

Windows
-------

- bpo-1102: Return ``None`` when ``View.Fetch()`` returns
  ``ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS`` instead of raising ``MSIError``.

  Initial patch by Anthony Tuininga.

- bpo-31944: Fixes Modify button in Apps and Features dialog.

macOS
-----

- bpo-31392: Update macOS installer to use OpenSSL 1.0.2m

IDLE
----

- bpo-32207: Improve tk event exception tracebacks in IDLE. When tk event
  handling is driven by IDLE's run loop, a confusing and distracting
  queue.EMPTY traceback context is no longer added to tk event exception
  tracebacks.  The traceback is now the same as when event handling is
  driven by user code.  Patch based on a suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-32164: Delete unused file idlelib/tabbedpages.py. Use of TabbedPageSet
  in configdialog was replaced by ttk.Notebook.

- bpo-32100: IDLE: Fix old and new bugs in pathbrowser; improve tests. Patch
  mostly by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31858: IDLE -- Restrict shell prompt manipulation to the shell. Editor
  and output windows only see an empty last prompt line.  This simplifies
  the code and fixes a minor bug when newline is inserted. Sys.ps1, if
  present, is read on Shell start-up, but is not set or changed.

- bpo-31860: The font sample in the IDLE configuration dialog is now
  editable. Changes persist while IDLE remains open

- bpo-31836: Test_code_module now passes if run after test_idle, which sets
  ps1.

  The code module uses sys.ps1 if present or sets it to '>>> ' if not.
  Test_code_module now properly tests both behaviors.  Ditto for ps2.

- bpo-28603: Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing a
  traceback that includes an exception that is unhashable. Patch by Zane
  Bitter.

- bpo-13802: Use non-Latin characters in the IDLE's Font settings sample.
  Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode
  Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a
  character. The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters a
  better idea of what they might see in IDLE's shell and editors. To make
  room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are re-arranged. The
  Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.

- bpo-31460: Simplify the API of IDLE's Module Browser.

  Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the option
  of creating a browser frame that is only part of a window.  Passing a full
  file name instead of pieces assumed to come from a .py file opens the
  possibility of browsing python files that do not end in .py.

- bpo-31649: IDLE - Make _htest, _utest parameters keyword only.

- bpo-31559: Remove test order dependence in idle_test.test_browser.

- bpo-31459: Rename IDLE's module browser from Class Browser to Module
  Browser. The original module-level class and method browser became a
  module browser, with the addition of module-level functions, years ago.
  Nested classes and functions were added yesterday.  For
  back-compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which
  appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, is not changed. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31500: Default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.

- bpo-1612262: IDLE module browser now shows nested classes and functions.
  Original patches for code and tests by Guilherme Polo and Cheryl Sabella,
  respectively.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-30722: Make redemo work with Python 3.6 and newer versions.

  Also, remove the ``LOCALE`` option since it doesn't work with string
  patterns in Python 3.

  Patch by Christoph Sarnowski.

C API
-----

- bpo-20891: Fix PyGILState_Ensure(). When PyGILState_Ensure() is called in
  a non-Python thread before PyEval_InitThreads(), only call
  PyEval_InitThreads() after calling PyThreadState_New() to fix a crash.

- bpo-31532: Fix memory corruption due to allocator mix in getpath.c between
  Py_GetPath() and Py_SetPath()

- bpo-30697: The `PyExc_RecursionErrorInst` singleton is removed and
  `PyErr_NormalizeException()` does not use it anymore. This singleton is
  persistent and its members being never cleared may cause a segfault during
  finalization of the interpreter. See also issue #22898.


What's New in Python 3.6.3 final?
=================================

*Release date: 2017-10-03*

-----------------

- bpo-31471: Fix an assertion failure in `subprocess.Popen()` on Windows, in
  case the env argument has a bad keys() method. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31418: Fix an assertion failure in `PyErr_WriteUnraisable()` in case
  of an exception with a bad ``__module__`` attribute. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31416: Fix assertion failures in case of a bad warnings.filters or
  warnings.defaultaction. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31411: Raise a TypeError instead of SystemError in case
  warnings.onceregistry is not a dictionary. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31373: Fix several possible instances of undefined behavior due to
  floating-point demotions.

- bpo-30465: Location information (``lineno`` and ``col_offset``) in
  f-strings is now (mostly) correct.  This fixes tools like flake8 from
  showing warnings on the wrong line (typically the first line of the file).

- bpo-31343: Include sys/sysmacros.h for major(), minor(), and makedev().
  GNU C libray plans to remove the functions from sys/types.h.

- bpo-31291: Fix an assertion failure in `zipimport.zipimporter.get_data` on
  Windows, when the return value of ``pathname.replace('/','\\')`` isn't a
  string. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31271: Fix an assertion failure in the write() method of
  `io.TextIOWrapper`, when the encoder doesn't return a bytes object. Patch
  by Oren Milman.

- bpo-31243: Fix a crash in some methods of `io.TextIOWrapper`, when the
  decoder's state is invalid. Patch by Oren Milman.

- bpo-30721: ``print`` now shows correct usage hint for using Python 2
  redirection syntax.  Patch by Sanyam Khurana.

- bpo-31070: Fix a race condition in importlib _get_module_lock().

- bpo-31095: Fix potential crash during GC caused by ``tp_dealloc`` which
  doesn't call ``PyObject_GC_UnTrack()``.

- bpo-31071: Avoid masking original TypeError in call with * unpacking when
  other arguments are passed.

- bpo-30978: str.format_map() now passes key lookup exceptions through.
  Previously any exception was replaced with a KeyError exception.

- bpo-30808: Use _Py_atomic API for concurrency-sensitive signal state.

- bpo-30876: Relative import from unloaded package now reimports the package
  instead of failing with SystemError.  Relative import from non-package now
  fails with ImportError rather than SystemError.

- bpo-30703: Improve signal delivery.

  Avoid using Py_AddPendingCall from signal handler, to avoid calling
  signal-unsafe functions. The tests I'm adding here fail without the rest
  of the patch, on Linux and OS X. This means our signal delivery logic had
  defects (some signals could be lost).

- bpo-30765: Avoid blocking in pthread_mutex_lock() when
  PyThread_acquire_lock() is asked not to block.

- bpo-31161: Make sure the 'Missing parentheses' syntax error message is
  only applied to SyntaxError, not to subclasses. Patch by Martijn Pieters.

- bpo-30814: Fixed a race condition when import a submodule from a package.

- bpo-30597: ``print`` now shows expected input in custom error message when
  used as a Python 2 statement. Patch by Sanyam Khurana.

Library
-------

- bpo-31499: xml.etree: Fix a crash when a parser is part of a reference
  cycle.

- bpo-28556: typing.get_type_hints now finds the right globalns for classes
  and modules by default (when no ``globalns`` was specified by the caller).

- bpo-28556: Speed improvements to the ``typing`` module.  Original PRs by
  Ivan Levkivskyi and Mitar.

- bpo-31544: The C accelerator module of ElementTree ignored exceptions
  raised when looking up TreeBuilder target methods in XMLParser().

- bpo-31234: socket.create_connection() now fixes manually a reference
  cycle: clear the variable storing the last exception on success.

- bpo-31457: LoggerAdapter objects can now be nested.

- bpo-31400: Improves SSL error handling to avoid losing error numbers.

- bpo-28958: ssl.SSLContext() now uses OpenSSL error information when a
  context cannot be instantiated.

- bpo-27340: SSLSocket.sendall() now uses memoryview to create slices of
  data. This fixes support for all bytes-like object. It is also more
  efficient and avoids costly copies.

- bpo-31178: Fix string concatenation bug in rare error path in the
  subprocess module

- bpo-31350: Micro-optimize :func:`asyncio._get_running_loop` to become up
  to 10% faster.

- bpo-31170: expat: Update libexpat from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4. Fix copying of
  partial characters for UTF-8 input (libexpat bug 115):
  https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/115

- bpo-29136: Add TLS 1.3 cipher suites and OP_NO_TLSv1_3.

- bpo-29212: Fix concurrent.futures.thread.ThreadPoolExecutor threads to
  have a non repr() based thread name by default when no thread_name_prefix
  is supplied. They will now identify themselves as
  "ThreadPoolExecutor-y_n".

- bpo-9146: Fix a segmentation fault in _hashopenssl when standard hash
  functions such as md5 are not available in the linked OpenSSL library.  As
  in some special FIPS-140 build environments.

- bpo-27144: The ``map()`` and ``as_completed()`` iterators in
  ``concurrent.futures`` now avoid keeping a reference to yielded objects.

- bpo-10746: Fix ctypes producing wrong PEP 3118 type codes for integer
  types.

- bpo-22536: The subprocess module now sets the filename when
  FileNotFoundError is raised on POSIX systems due to the executable or cwd
  not being found.

- bpo-31249: concurrent.futures: WorkItem.run() used by ThreadPoolExecutor
  now breaks a reference cycle between an exception object and the WorkItem
  object.

- bpo-31247: xmlrpc.server now explicitly breaks reference cycles when using
  sys.exc_info() in code handling exceptions.

- bpo-30102: The ssl and hashlib modules now call
  OPENSSL_add_all_algorithms_noconf() on OpenSSL < 1.1.0. The function
  detects CPU features and enables optimizations on some CPU architectures
  such as POWER8. Patch is based on research from Gustavo Serra Scalet.

- bpo-31185: Fixed miscellaneous errors in asyncio speedup module.

- bpo-31135: ttk: fix the destroy() method of LabeledScale and OptionMenu
  classes. Call the parent destroy() method even if the used attribute
  doesn't exist. The LabeledScale.destroy() method now also explicitly
  clears label and scale attributes to help the garbage collector to destroy
  all widgets.

- bpo-31107: Fix `copyreg._slotnames()` mangled attribute calculation for
  classes whose name begins with an underscore. Patch by Shane Harvey.

- bpo-31061: Fixed a crash when using asyncio and threads.

  Heimes.

- bpo-30119: ftplib.FTP.putline() now throws ValueError on commands that
  contains CR or LF. Patch by Dong-hee Na.

- bpo-30595: multiprocessing.Queue.get() with a timeout now polls its reader
  in non-blocking mode if it succeeded to acquire the lock but the acquire
  took longer than the timeout.

- bpo-29403: Fix ``unittest.mock``'s autospec to not fail on method-bound
  builtin functions.  Patch by Aaron Gallagher.

- bpo-30961: Fix decrementing a borrowed reference in tracemalloc.

- bpo-25684: Change ``ttk.OptionMenu`` radiobuttons to be unique across
  instances of ``OptionMenu``.

- bpo-30886: Fix multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread(): it now waits until the
  thread completes, even if the thread was started by the same process which
  created the queue.

- bpo-29854: Fix segfault in readline when using readline's history-size
  option.  Patch by Nir Soffer.

- bpo-30319: socket.close() now ignores ECONNRESET error.

- bpo-30828: Fix out of bounds write in
  `asyncio.CFuture.remove_done_callback()`.

- bpo-30807: signal.setitimer() may disable the timer when passed a tiny
  value.

  Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(),
  which is specified as taking microsecond-resolution intervals. However, on
  some platform, our conversion routine could convert 1e-6 into a zero
  interval, therefore disabling the timer instead of (re-)scheduling it.

- bpo-30441: Fix bug when modifying os.environ while iterating over it

- bpo-30532: Fix email header value parser dropping folding white space in
  certain cases.

- bpo-30879: os.listdir() and os.scandir() now emit bytes names when called
  with bytes-like argument.

- bpo-30746: Prohibited the '=' character in environment variable names in
  ``os.putenv()`` and ``os.spawn*()``.

- bpo-29755: Fixed the lgettext() family of functions in the gettext module.
  They now always return bytes.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-31294: Fix incomplete code snippet in the ZeroMQSocketListener and
  ZeroMQSocketHandler examples and adapt them to Python 3.

- bpo-21649: Add RFC 7525 and Mozilla server side TLS links to SSL
  documentation.

- bpo-30803: Clarify doc on truth value testing. Original patch by Peter
  Thomassen.

Tests
-----

- bpo-31320: Silence traceback in test_ssl

- bpo-25674: Remove sha256.tbs-internet.com ssl test

- bpo-30715: Address ALPN callback changes for OpenSSL 1.1.0f. The latest
  version behaves like OpenSSL 1.0.2 and no longer aborts handshake.

- bpo-30822: regrtest: Exclude tzdata from regrtest --all. When running the
  test suite using --use=all / -u all, exclude tzdata since it makes
  test_datetime too slow (15-20 min on some buildbots) which then times out
  on some buildbots. Fix also regrtest command line parser to allow passing
  -u extralargefile to run test_zipfile64.

Build
-----

- bpo-30854: Fix compile error when compiling --without-threads. Patch by
  Masayuki Yamamoto.

Windows
-------

- bpo-30389: Adds detection of Visual Studio 2017 to distutils on Windows.

- bpo-31340: Change to building with MSVC v141 (included with Visual Studio
  2017)

- bpo-30581: os.cpu_count() now returns the correct number of processors on
  Windows when the number of logical processors is greater than 64.

- bpo-30731: Add a missing xmlns to python.manifest so that it matches the
  schema.

IDLE
----

- bpo-31493: IDLE code context -- fix code update and font update timers.

  Canceling timers prevents a warning message when test_idle completes.

- bpo-31488: IDLE - Update non-key options in former extension classes. When
  applying configdialog changes, call .reload for each feature class. Change
  ParenMatch so updated options affect existing instances attached to
  existing editor windows.

- bpo-31477: IDLE - Improve rstrip entry in doc. Strip trailing whitespace
  strips more than blank spaces.  Multiline string literals are not skipped.

- bpo-31480: IDLE - make tests pass with zzdummy extension disabled by
  default.

- bpo-31421: Document how IDLE runs tkinter programs. IDLE calls tcl/tk
  update in the background in order to make live

  interaction and experimentation with tkinter applications much easier.

- bpo-31414: IDLE -- fix tk entry box tests by deleting first. Adding to an
  int entry is not the same as deleting and inserting because int('') will
  fail.

- bpo-31051: Rearrange IDLE configdialog GenPage into Window, Editor, and
  Help sections.

- bpo-30617: IDLE - Add docstrings and tests for outwin subclass of editor.

  Move some data and functions from the class to module level. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31287: IDLE - Do not modify tkinter.message in test_configdialog.

- bpo-27099: Convert IDLE's built-in 'extensions' to regular features.

  About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions.
  Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not
  good for maintenance.  Hence the conversion.

  The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings for
  builtin features are now handled uniformly.  Now, editing a binding in a
  keyset only affects its value in the keyset.  All bindings are defined
  together in the system-specific default keysets in config-extensions.def.
  All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-extension.cfg.  All take
  effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok.

  The affected events are '<<force-open-completions>>', '<<expand-word>>',
  '<<force-open-calltip>>', '<<flash-paren>>', '<<format-paragraph>>',
  '<<run-module>>', '<<check-module>>', and '<<zoom-height>>'.  Any (global)
  customizations made before 3.6.3 will not affect their keyset-specific
  customization after 3.6.3. and vice versa.

  Inital patch by Charles Wohlganger.

- bpo-31206: IDLE: Factor HighPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31001: Add tests for configdialog highlight tab.  Patch by Cheryl
  Sabella.

- bpo-31205: IDLE: Factor KeysPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog.  The
  slightly modified tests continue to pass.  Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

  Victor Stinner.

- bpo-31002: Add tests for configdialog keys tab. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-19903: IDLE: Calltips use `inspect.signature` instead of
  `inspect.getfullargspec`. This improves calltips for builtins converted to
  use Argument Clinic. Patch by Louie Lu.

- bpo-31083: IDLE - Add an outline of a TabPage class in configdialog.
  Update existing classes to match outline. Initial patch by Cheryl Sabella.

  by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-30781: IDLE - Use ttk widgets in ConfigDialog. Patches by Terry Jan
  Reedy and Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-31060: IDLE - Finish rearranging methods of ConfigDialog Grouping
  methods pertaining to each tab and the buttons will aid writing tests and
  improving the tabs and will enable splitting the groups into classes.

- bpo-30853: IDLE -- Factor a VarTrace class out of ConfigDialog.

  Instance tracers manages pairs consisting of a tk variable and a callback
  function.  When tracing is turned on, setting the variable calls the
  function.  Test coverage for the new class is 100%.

- bpo-31003: IDLE: Add more tests for General tab.

- bpo-30993: IDLE - Improve configdialog font page and tests.

  In configdialog: Document causal pathways in create_font_tab docstring.
  Simplify some attribute names. Move set_samples calls to var_changed_font
  (idea from Cheryl Sabella).  Move related functions to positions after the
  create widgets function.

  In test_configdialog: Fix test_font_set so not order dependent.  Fix
  renamed test_indent_scale so it tests the widget.  Adjust tests for
  movement of set_samples call.  Add tests for load functions.  Put all font
  tests in one class and tab indent tests in another.  Except for two lines,
  these tests completely cover the related functions.

- bpo-30981: IDLE -- Add more configdialog font page tests.

- bpo-28523: IDLE: replace 'colour' with 'color' in configdialog.

- bpo-30917: Add tests for idlelib.config.IdleConf. Increase coverage from
  46% to 96%. Patch by Louie Lu.

- bpo-30934: Document coverage details for idlelib tests.

  * Add section to idlelib/idle-test/README.txt.

  * Include check that branches are taken both ways.

  * Exclude IDLE-specific code that does not run during unit tests.

- bpo-30913: IDLE: Document ConfigDialog tk Vars, methods, and widgets in
  docstrings This will facilitate improving the dialog and splitting up the
  class. Original patch by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-30899: IDLE: Add tests for ConfigParser subclasses in config. Patch by
  Louie Lu.

- bpo-30881: IDLE: Add docstrings to browser.py. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-30851: IDLE: Remove unused variables in configdialog.  One is a
  duplicate, one is set but cannot be altered by users. Patch by Cheryl
  Sabella.

- bpo-30870: IDLE: In Settings dialog, select font with Up, Down keys as
  well as mouse. Initial patch by Louie Lu.

- bpo-8231: IDLE: call config.IdleConf.GetUserCfgDir only once.

- bpo-30779: IDLE: Factor ConfigChanges class from configdialog, put in
  config; test. * In config, put dump test code in a function; run it and
  unittest in   'if __name__ == '__main__'. * Add class config.ConfigChanges
  based on changes_class_v4.py on bpo issue. * Add class
  test_config.ChangesTest, partly using configdialog_tests_v1.py. * Revise
  configdialog to use ConfigChanges; see tracker msg297804. * Revise
  test_configdialog to match configdialog changes. * Remove configdialog
  functions unused or moved to ConfigChanges. Cheryl Sabella contributed
  parts of the patch.

- bpo-30777: IDLE: configdialog - Add docstrings and fix comments. Patch by
  Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-30495: IDLE: Improve textview with docstrings, PEP8 names, and more
  tests. Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-30723: IDLE: Make several improvements to parenmatch. Add 'parens'
  style to highlight both opener and closer. Make 'default' style, which is
  not default, a synonym for 'opener'. Make time-delay work the same with
  all styles. Add help for config dialog extensions tab, including help for
  parenmatch. Add new tests.  Original patch by Charles Wohlganger.

- bpo-30674: IDLE: add docstrings to grep module. Patch by Cheryl Sabella

- bpo-21519: IDLE's basic custom key entry dialog now detects duplicates
  properly. Original patch by Saimadhav Heblikar.

- bpo-29910: IDLE no longer deletes a character after commenting out a
  region by a key shortcut.  Add ``return 'break'`` for this and other
  potential conflicts between IDLE and default key bindings.

- bpo-30728: Review and change idlelib.configdialog names. Lowercase method
  and attribute names. Replace 'colour' with 'color', expand overly cryptic
  names, delete unneeded underscores. Replace ``import *`` with specific
  imports. Patches by Cheryl Sabella.

- bpo-6739: IDLE: Verify user-entered key sequences by trying to bind them
  with tk. Add tests for all 3 validation functions. Original patch by G
  Polo.  Tests added by Cheryl Sabella.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-30983: gdb integration commands (py-bt, etc.) work on optimized shared
  builds now, too.  PEP 523 introduced _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault which
  inlines PyEval_EvalFrameEx on non-debug shared builds.  This broke the
  ability to use py-bt, py-up, and a few other Python-specific gdb
  integrations. The problem is fixed by only looking for
  _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault frames in python-gdb.py.  Original patch by Bruno
  "Polaco" Penteado.


What's New in Python 3.6.2 final?
=================================

*Release date: 2017-07-17*

No changes since release candidate 2



What's New in Python 3.6.2 release candidate 2?
===============================================

*Release date: 2017-07-07*

Security
--------

- bpo-30730: Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on
  Windows.  Prevent passing other environment variables and command
  arguments.

- bpo-30694: Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple
  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0's fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesn't
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using ``XML_SetHashSalt()``.

- bpo-30500: Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, ``splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')`` now correctly returns the
  ``127.0.0.1`` host, instead of treating ``@evil.com`` as the host in an
  authentication (``login@host``).

IDLE
----

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-30176: Add missing attribute related constants in curses
  documentation.

- bpo-30052: the link targets for :func:`bytes` and :func:`bytearray` are
  now their respective type definitions, rather than the corresponding
  builtin function entries. Use :ref:`bytes <func-bytes>` and
  :ref:`bytearray <func-bytearray>` to reference the latter.

  In order to ensure this and future cross-reference updates are applied
  automatically, the daily documentation builds now disable the default
  output caching features in Sphinx.

- bpo-26985: Add missing info of code object in inspect documentation.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-29367: python-gdb.py now supports also ``method-wrapper``
  (``wrapperobject``) objects.

Tests
-----

- bpo-30357: test_thread: setUp() now uses support.threading_setup() and
  support.threading_cleanup() to wait until threads complete to avoid random
  side effects on following tests. Initial patch written by Grzegorz
  Grzywacz.

- bpo-30197: Enhanced functions swap_attr() and swap_item() in the
  test.support module. They now work when delete replaced attribute or item
  inside the with statement.  The old value of the attribute or item (or
  None if it doesn't exist) now will be assigned to the target of the "as"
  clause, if there is one.

Windows
-------

- bpo-30687: Locate msbuild.exe on Windows when building rather than
  vcvarsall.bat

- bpo-30450: The build process on Windows no longer depends on Subversion,
  instead pulling external code from GitHub via a Python script.  If Python
  3.6 is not found on the system (via ``py -3.6``), NuGet is used to
  download a copy of 32-bit Python.


What's New in Python 3.6.1 final?
=================================

*Release date: 2017-03-21*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-29723: The ``sys.path[0]`` initialization change for bpo-29139 caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing ``__main__`` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import
  location's parent directory to ``sys.path``, and ensures no other
  ``sys.path`` entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import
  location named on the command line.

Build
-----

- bpo-27593: fix format of git information used in sys.version

- Fix incompatible comment in python.h

What's New in Python 3.6.0 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2016-12-06*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-23722: Rather than silently producing a class that doesn't support
  zero-argument ``super()`` in methods, failing to pass the new
  ``__classcell__`` namespace entry up to ``type.__new__`` now results in a
  ``DeprecationWarning`` and a class that supports zero-argument
  ``super()``.

- bpo-28797: Modifying the class __dict__ inside the __set_name__ method of
  a descriptor that is used inside that class no longer prevents calling the
  __set_name__ method of other descriptors.

  the next instruction is YIELD_FROM. Regression introduced by WORDCODE
  (issue #26647).

Library
-------

  warnings.showwarning() if it was overriden inside the context manager.

- bpo-27172: To assist with upgrades from 2.7, the previously documented
  deprecation of ``inspect.getfullargspec()`` has been reversed. This
  decision may be revisited again after the Python 2.7 branch is no longer
  officially supported.

- bpo-26273: Add new :data:`socket.TCP_CONGESTION` (Linux 2.6.13) and
  :data:`socket.TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` (Linux 2.6.37) constants. Patch written by

  New guide now cover the additional ``__classcell__`` handling needed for
  custom metaclasses to fully support PEP 487 and zero-argument ``super()``.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-28023: Fix python-gdb.py didn't support new dict implementation.

*Release date: 2016-09-12*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-23722: The __class__ cell used by zero-argument super() is now
  initialized from type.__new__ rather than __build_class__, so class
  methods relying on that will now work correctly when called from metaclass
  methods during class creation. Patch by Martin Teichmann.

- bpo-25221: Fix corrupted result from PyLong_FromLong(0) when Python is
  compiled with NSMALLPOSINTS = 0.

- bpo-27080: Implement formatting support for PEP 515.  Initial patch by

  Patch by Jason Fried.

- bpo-27948: In f-strings, only allow backslashes inside the braces (where
  the expressions are).  This is a breaking change from the 3.6 alpha
  releases, where backslashes are allowed anywhere in an f-string.  Also,
  require that expressions inside f-strings be enclosed within literal
  braces, and not escapes like ``f'\x7b"hi"\x7d'``.

- bpo-28046: Remove platform-specific directories from sys.path.

- bpo-28071: Add early-out for differencing from an empty set.

- bpo-25758: Prevents zipimport from unnecessarily encoding a filename

  efficient bytecode. Patch by Demur Rumed, design by Serhiy Storchaka,
  reviewed by Serhiy Storchaka and Victor Stinner.

  Patch by Ivan Levkivskyi.

- bpo-28003: Implement PEP 525 -- Asynchronous Generators.

- bpo-27985: Implement PEP 526 -- Syntax for Variable Annotations. Patch by
  Ivan Levkivskyi.

- bpo-26058: Add a new private version to the builtin dict type, incremented
  at each dictionary creation and at each dictionary change. Implementation
  of the PEP 509.

- bpo-27364: A backslash-character pair that is not a valid escape sequence
  now generates a DeprecationWarning.  Patch by Emanuel Barry.

  ``exec_builtin_or_dynamic()``.

- bpo-27078: Added BUILD_STRING opcode.  Optimized f-strings evaluation.

- bpo-17884: Python now requires systems with inttypes.h and stdint.h

- bpo-27961: Require platforms to support ``long long``. Python hasn't
  compiled without ``long long`` for years, so this is basically a
  formality.

- bpo-27355: Removed support for Windows CE.  It was never finished, and
  Windows CE is no longer a relevant platform for Python.

- Implement PEP 523.

- bpo-27870: A left shift of zero by a large integer no longer attempts to
  allocate large amounts of memory.

- bpo-25402: In int-to-decimal-string conversion, improve the estimate of
  the intermediate memory required, and remove an unnecessarily strict
  overflow check. Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-27214: In long_invert, be more careful about modifying object returned
  by long_add, and remove an unnecessary check for small longs. Thanks Oren
  Milman for analysis and patch.

- bpo-27506: Support passing the bytes/bytearray.translate() "delete"
  argument by keyword.

- bpo-27812: Properly clear out a generator's frame's backreference to the
  generator to prevent crashes in frame.clear().

  use of 'def' in _PyState_AddModule(). Initial patch by Christian Heimes.

- bpo-27792: The modulo operation applied to ``bool`` and other ``int``
  subclasses now always returns an ``int``. Previously the return type
  depended on the input values. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-26984: int() now always returns an instance of exact int.

- bpo-25604: Fix a minor bug in integer true division; this bug could
  potentially have caused off-by-one-ulp results on platforms with
  unreliable ldexp implementations.

- bpo-24254: Make class definition namespace ordered by default.

- bpo-27662: Fix an overflow check in ``List_New``: the original code was
  checking against ``Py_SIZE_MAX`` instead of the correct upper bound of
  ``Py_SSIZE_T_MAX``. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-27782: Multi-phase extension module import now correctly allows the
  ``m_methods`` field to be used to add module level functions to instances
  of non-module types returned from ``Py_create_mod``. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-27936: The round() function accepted a second None argument for some
  types but not for others.  Fixed the inconsistency by accepting None for
  all numeric types.

- bpo-27487: Warn if a submodule argument to "python -m" or
  runpy.run_module() is found in sys.modules after parent packages are
  imported, but before the submodule is executed.

- bpo-27157: Make only type() itself accept the one-argument form. Patch by
  Eryk Sun and Emanuel Barry.

- bpo-27558: Fix a SystemError in the implementation of "raise" statement.
  In a brand new thread, raise a RuntimeError since there is no active

  encoded as an iterable of integers. Now only strings and byte-like objects
  are accepted.

- bpo-26536: socket.ioctl now supports SIO_LOOPBACK_FAST_PATH. Patch by
  Daniel Stokes.

- bpo-27048: Prevents distutils failing on Windows when environment
  variables contain non-ASCII characters

- bpo-27330: Fixed possible leaks in the ctypes module.

- bpo-27238: Got rid of bare excepts in the turtle module.  Original patch
  by Jelle Zijlstra.

- bpo-27122: When an exception is raised within the context being managed by
  a contextlib.ExitStack() and one of the exit stack generators catches and
  raises it in a chain, do not re-raise the original exception when exiting,
  let the new chained one through.  This avoids the PEP 479 bug described in
  issue25782.

Security
--------

- bpo-27278: Fix os.urandom() implementation using getrandom() on Linux.
  Truncate size to INT_MAX and loop until we collected enough random bytes,
  instead of casting a directly Py_ssize_t to int.

Library
-------

  Module had subclasses SectionName, ModuleName, and HelpSource, which are
  used to get information from users by configdialog and file =>Load Module.
  Each subclass has itw own validity checks.  Using ModuleName allows users
  to edit bad module names instead of starting over. Add tests and delete
  the two files combined into the new one.

- bpo-27372: Test_idle no longer changes the locale.

- bpo-27365: Allow non-ascii chars in IDLE NEWS.txt, for contributor names.

- bpo-27245: IDLE: Cleanly delete custom themes and key bindings.
  Previously, when IDLE was started from a console or by import, a cascade
  of warnings was emitted. Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

  now be of the same feature version (e.g. 3.6) as the source being built.

- bpo-26930: Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2h.

- bpo-23968: Rename the platform directory from plat-$(MACHDEP) to
  plat-$(PLATFORM_TRIPLET). Rename the config directory (LIBPL) from

What's New in Python 3.6.0 alpha 2?
===================================

*Release date: 2016-06-13*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-27095: Simplified MAKE_FUNCTION and removed MAKE_CLOSURE opcodes.
  Patch by Demur Rumed.

- bpo-27190: Raise NotSupportedError if sqlite3 is older than 3.3.1. Patch
  by Dave Sawyer.

- bpo-27286: Fixed compiling BUILD_MAP_UNPACK_WITH_CALL opcode.  Calling
  function with generalized unpacking (PEP 448) and conflicting keyword
  names could cause undefined behavior.

- bpo-27140: Added BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP opcode.

- bpo-27186: Add support for os.PathLike objects to open() (part of PEP
  519).

- bpo-27066: Fixed SystemError if a custom opener (for open()) returns a
  negative number without setting an exception.

- bpo-26983: float() now always return an instance of exact float. The
  deprecation warning is emitted if __float__ returns an instance of a
  strict subclass of float.  In a future versions of Python this can be an
  error.

- bpo-27097: Python interpreter is now about 7% faster due to optimized
  instruction decoding.  Based on patch by Demur Rumed.

- bpo-26647: Python interpreter now uses 16-bit wordcode instead of
  bytecode. Patch by Demur Rumed.

- bpo-23275: Allow assigning to an empty target list in round brackets: () =
  iterable.

- bpo-27243: Update the __aiter__ protocol: instead of returning an
  awaitable that resolves to an asynchronous iterator, the asynchronous
  iterator should be returned directly.  Doing the former will trigger a
  PendingDeprecationWarning.

Library
-------

- Comment out socket (SO_REUSEPORT) and posix (O_SHLOCK, O_EXLOCK) constants
  exposed on the API which are not implemented on GNU/Hurd. They would not
  work at runtime anyway.

  documented since 07a5610bae9d.  Initial patch by Roger Luethi.

- bpo-27029: Removed deprecated support of universal newlines mode from
  ZipFile.open().

- bpo-27030: Unknown escapes consisting of ``'\'`` and an ASCII letter in
  regular expressions now are errors.  The re.LOCALE flag now can be used

  os.fsdecode() (part of PEP 519).

- bpo-27186: Introduce os.PathLike and os.fspath() (part of PEP 519).

- A new version of typing.py provides several new classes and features:
  @overload outside stubs, Reversible, DefaultDict, Text, ContextManager,
  Type[], NewType(), TYPE_CHECKING, and numerous bug fixes (note that some
  of the new features are not yet implemented in mypy or other static
  analyzers). Also classes for PEP 492 (Awaitable, AsyncIterable,
  AsyncIterator) have been added (in fact they made it into 3.5.1 but were
  never mentioned).

- bpo-25738: Stop http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.send_error() from
  sending a message body for 205 Reset Content.  Also, don't send Content
  header fields in responses that don't have a body.  Patch by Susumu
  Koshiba.

- bpo-21313: Fix the "platform" module to tolerate when sys.version contains
  truncated build information.

Security
--------

- bpo-26839: On Linux, :func:`os.urandom` now calls ``getrandom()`` with

  entropy pool is not initialized yet. Patch written by Colm Buckley.

Library
-------

- bpo-23883: Added missing APIs to __all__ to match the documented APIs for
  the following modules: cgi, mailbox, mimetypes, plistlib and smtpd.
  Patches by Jacek Kołodziej.

- bpo-21272: Use _sysconfigdata.py to initialize distutils.sysconfig.

- bpo-19611: :mod:`inspect` now reports the implicit ``.0`` parameters
  generated by the compiler for comprehension and generator expression
  scopes as if they were positional-only parameters called ``implicit0``.
  Patch by Jelle Zijlstra.

- bpo-26809: Add ``__all__`` to :mod:`string`.  Patch by Emanuel Barry.

- bpo-26373: subprocess.Popen.communicate now correctly ignores
  BrokenPipeError when the child process dies before .communicate() is
  called in more/all circumstances.

- signal, socket, and ssl module IntEnum constant name lookups now return a
  consistent name for values having multiple names.  Ex: signal.Signals(6)
  now refers to itself as signal.SIGALRM rather than flipping between that
  and signal.SIGIOT based on the interpreter's hash randomization seed.

- bpo-27167: Clarify the subprocess.CalledProcessError error message text
  when the child process died due to a signal.

- bpo-25931: Don't define socketserver.Forking* names on platforms such as
  Windows that do not support os.fork().

  deserialize a lot of small objects.

- bpo-21271: New keyword only parameters in reset_mock call.

IDLE
----

- bpo-5124: Paste with text selected now replaces the selection on X11. This
  matches how paste works on Windows, Mac, most modern Linux apps, and ttk
  widgets. Original patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-24750: Switch all scrollbars in IDLE to ttk versions. Where needed,
  minimal tests are added to cover changes.

- bpo-24759: IDLE requires tk 8.5 and availability ttk widgets. Delete now
  unneeded tk version tests and code for older versions. Add test for IDLE
  syntax colorizer.

- bpo-27239: idlelib.macosx.isXyzTk functions initialize as needed.

- bpo-27262: move Aqua unbinding code, which enable context menus, to
  macosx.

  a private implementation of test.test_idle and tool for maintainers.

- bpo-27196: Stop 'ThemeChanged' warnings when running IDLE tests. These
  persisted after other warnings were suppressed in #20567. Apply Serhiy
  Storchaka's update_idletasks solution to four test files. Record this
  additional advice in idle_test/README.txt

- bpo-20567: Revise idle_test/README.txt with advice about avoiding tk
  warning messages from tests.  Apply advice to several IDLE tests.

- bpo-27117: Make colorizer htest and turtledemo work with dark themes. Move
  code for configuring text widget colors to a new function.

- bpo-24225: Rename many `idlelib/*.py` and `idle_test/test_*.py` files.
  Edit files to replace old names with new names when the old name referred
  to the module rather than the class it contained. See the issue and IDLE
  section in What's New in 3.6 for more.

- bpo-26673: When tk reports font size as 0, change to size 10. Such fonts
  on Linux prevented the configuration dialog from opening.

What's New in Python 3.6.0 alpha 1?
===================================

*Release date: 2016-05-16*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-20041: Fixed TypeError when frame.f_trace is set to None. Patch by
  Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-26168: Fixed possible refleaks in failing Py_BuildValue() with the "N"
  format unit.

  unscathed to the C-defined function.  Now it is converted to exact dict.

- bpo-26811: gc.get_objects() no longer contains a broken tuple with NULL
  pointer.

- bpo-20120: Use RawConfigParser for .pypirc parsing, removing support for
  interpolation unintentionally added with move to Python 3. Behavior no
  longer does any interpolation in .pypirc files, matching behavior in
  Python 2.7 and Setuptools 19.0.

- bpo-26249: Memory functions of the :c:func:`PyMem_Malloc` domain
  (:c:data:`PYMEM_DOMAIN_MEM`) now use the :ref:`pymalloc allocator
  <pymalloc>` rather than system :c:func:`malloc`. Applications calling
  :c:func:`PyMem_Malloc` without holding the GIL can now crash: use
  ``PYTHONMALLOC=debug`` environment variable to validate the usage of
  memory allocators in your application.

- bpo-26802: Optimize function calls only using unpacking like
  ``func(*tuple)`` (no other positional argument, no keyword): avoid copying
  the tuple. Patch written by Joe Jevnik.

- bpo-26659: Make the builtin slice type support cycle collection.

- bpo-26718: super.__init__ no longer leaks memory if called multiple times.
  NOTE: A direct call of super.__init__ is not endorsed!

- bpo-27138: Fix the doc comment for FileFinder.find_spec().

- bpo-25339: PYTHONIOENCODING now has priority over locale in setting the
  error handler for stdin and stdout.

- bpo-26494: Fixed crash on iterating exhausting iterators. Affected classes
  are generic sequence iterators, iterators of str, bytes, bytearray, list,
  tuple, set, frozenset, dict, OrderedDict, corresponding views and
  os.scandir() iterator.

- bpo-26574: Optimize ``bytes.replace(b'', b'.')`` and
  ``bytearray.replace(b'', b'.')``. Patch written by Josh Snider.

- bpo-26581: If coding cookie is specified multiple times on a line in
  Python source code file, only the first one is taken to account.

- bpo-19711: Add tests for reloading namespace packages.

- bpo-21099: Switch applicable importlib tests to use PEP 451 API.

- bpo-26563: Debug hooks on Python memory allocators now raise a fatal error
  if functions of the :c:func:`PyMem_Malloc` family are called without
  holding the GIL.

- bpo-26564: On error, the debug hooks on Python memory allocators now use
  the :mod:`tracemalloc` module to get the traceback where a memory block
  was allocated.

- bpo-26558: The debug hooks on Python memory allocator
  :c:func:`PyObject_Malloc` now detect when functions are called without
  holding the GIL.

- bpo-26516: Add :envvar:`PYTHONMALLOC` environment variable to set the
  Python memory allocators and/or install debug hooks.

- bpo-26516: The :c:func:`PyMem_SetupDebugHooks` function can now also be
  used on Python compiled in release mode.

- bpo-26516: The :envvar:`PYTHONMALLOCSTATS` environment variable can now
  also be used on Python compiled in release mode. It now has no effect if
  set to an empty string.

- bpo-26516: In debug mode, debug hooks are now also installed on Python
  memory allocators when Python is configured without pymalloc.

- bpo-26464: Fix str.translate() when string is ASCII and first replacements
  removes character, but next replacement uses a non-ASCII character or a
  string longer than 1 character. Regression introduced in Python 3.5.0.

- bpo-22836: Ensure exception reports from PyErr_Display() and
  PyErr_WriteUnraisable() are sensible even when formatting them produces
  secondary errors.  This affects the reports produced by
  sys.__excepthook__() and when __del__() raises an exception.

- bpo-26302: Correct behavior to reject comma as a legal character for
  cookie names.

- bpo-26136: Upgrade the warning when a generator raises StopIteration from
  PendingDeprecationWarning to DeprecationWarning.  Patch by Anish Shah.

- bpo-26204: The compiler now ignores all constant statements: bytes, str,
  int, float, complex, name constants (None, False, True), Ellipsis and
  ast.Constant; not only str and int. For example, ``1.0`` is now ignored in
  ``def f(): 1.0``.

- bpo-4806: Avoid masking the original TypeError exception when using star
  (``*``) unpacking in function calls.  Based on patch by Hagen Fürstenau
  and Daniel Urban.

- bpo-26146: Add a new kind of AST node: ``ast.Constant``. It can be used by
  external AST optimizers, but the compiler does not emit directly such
  node.

- bpo-23601: Sped-up allocation of dict key objects by using Python's small
  object allocator.  (Contributed by Julian Taylor.)

- bpo-18018: Import raises ImportError instead of SystemError if a relative
  import is attempted without a known parent package.

- bpo-25843: When compiling code, don't merge constants if they are equal
  but have a different types. For example, ``f1, f2 = lambda: 1, lambda:
  1.0`` is now correctly compiled to two different functions: ``f1()``
  returns ``1`` (``int``) and ``f2()`` returns ``1.0`` (``float``), even if
  ``1`` and ``1.0`` are equal.

- bpo-26107: The format of the ``co_lnotab`` attribute of code objects
  changes to support negative line number delta.

- bpo-26154: Add a new private _PyThreadState_UncheckedGet() function to get
  the current Python thread state, but don't issue a fatal error if it is
  NULL. This new function must be used instead of accessing directly the
  _PyThreadState_Current variable.  The variable is no more exposed since
  Python 3.5.1 to hide the exact implementation of atomic C types, to avoid
  compiler issues.

- bpo-25791: If __package__ != __spec__.parent or if neither __package__ or
  __spec__ are defined then ImportWarning is raised.

- bpo-22995: [UPDATE] Comment out the one of the pickleability tests in
  _PyObject_GetState() due to regressions observed in Cython-based projects.

- bpo-25961: Disallowed null characters in the type name.

- bpo-25973: Fix segfault when an invalid nonlocal statement binds a name
  starting with two underscores.

- bpo-22995: Instances of extension types with a state that aren't
  subclasses of list or dict and haven't implemented any pickle-related
  methods (__reduce__, __reduce_ex__, __getnewargs__, __getnewargs_ex__, or
  __getstate__), can no longer be pickled.  Including memoryview.

- bpo-20440: Massive replacing unsafe attribute setting code with special
  macro Py_SETREF.

- bpo-25766: Special method __bytes__() now works in str subclasses.

- bpo-25421: __sizeof__ methods of builtin types now use dynamic basic size.
  This allows sys.getsize() to work correctly with their subclasses with
  __slots__ defined.

- bpo-25709: Fixed problem with in-place string concatenation and utf-8
  cache.

- bpo-5319: New Py_FinalizeEx() API allowing Python to set an exit status of
  120 on failure to flush buffered streams.

- bpo-25485: telnetlib.Telnet is now a context manager.

- bpo-24097: Fixed crash in object.__reduce__() if slot name is freed inside
  __getattr__.

- bpo-24731: Fixed crash on converting objects with special methods
  __bytes__, __trunc__, and __float__ returning instances of subclasses of
  bytes, int, and float to subclasses of bytes, int, and float
  correspondingly.

- bpo-25630: Fix a possible segfault during argument parsing in functions
  that accept filesystem paths.

- bpo-23564: Fixed a partially broken sanity check in the _posixsubprocess
  internals regarding how fds_to_pass were passed to the child.  The bug had
  no actual impact as subprocess.py already avoided it.

- bpo-25388: Fixed tokenizer crash when processing undecodable source code
  with a null byte.

- bpo-25462: The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most
  operations in C implementation of OrderedDict.

- bpo-22995: Default implementation of __reduce__ and __reduce_ex__ now
  rejects builtin types with not defined __new__.

- bpo-24802: Avoid buffer overreads when int(), float(), compile(), exec()
  and eval() are passed bytes-like objects.  These objects are not
  necessarily terminated by a null byte, but the functions assumed they
  were.

- bpo-25555: Fix parser and AST: fill lineno and col_offset of "arg" node
  when compiling AST from Python objects.

- bpo-24726: Fixed a crash and leaking NULL in repr() of OrderedDict that
  was mutated by direct calls of dict methods.

- bpo-25449: Iterating OrderedDict with keys with unstable hash now raises
  KeyError in C implementations as well as in Python implementation.

- bpo-25395: Fixed crash when highly nested OrderedDict structures were
  garbage collected.

- bpo-25401: Optimize bytes.fromhex() and bytearray.fromhex(): they are now
  between 2x and 3.5x faster.

- bpo-25399: Optimize bytearray % args using the new private _PyBytesWriter
  API. Formatting is now between 2.5 and 5 times faster.

- bpo-25274: sys.setrecursionlimit() now raises a RecursionError if the new
  recursion limit is too low depending at the current recursion depth.
  Modify also the "lower-water mark" formula to make it monotonic. This mark
  is used to decide when the overflowed flag of the thread state is reset.

- bpo-24402: Fix input() to prompt to the redirected stdout when
  sys.stdout.fileno() fails.

- bpo-25349: Optimize bytes % args using the new private _PyBytesWriter API.
  Formatting is now up to 2 times faster.

- bpo-24806: Prevent builtin types that are not allowed to be subclassed
  from being subclassed through multiple inheritance.

- bpo-25003: On Solaris 11.3 or newer, os.urandom() now uses the getrandom()
  function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy() function
  is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom() doesn't
  need such high-quality entropy.

  list of a function declaration.  For example, "def f(\*, a = 3,): pass" is
  now legal. Patch from Mark Dickinson.

  Eric V. Smith.

- bpo-26478: Fix semantic bugs when using binary operators with dictionary
  views and tuples.

  with non-ASCII bytes, but "http.client" requires the request target to be
  ASCII-encodable, otherwise a UnicodeEncodeError is raised.  Based on patch
  by Christian Heimes.

- bpo-27033: The default value of the decode_data parameter for
  smtpd.SMTPChannel and smtpd.SMTPServer constructors is changed to False.

  if iterated array is extended.

- bpo-26641: doctest.DocFileTest and doctest.testfile() now support packages
  (module splitted into multiple directories) for the package parameter.

- bpo-25195: Fix a regression in mock.MagicMock. _Call is a subclass of
  tuple (changeset 3603bae63c13 only works for classes) so we need to

  between best and worst times. Patch from Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-24633: site-packages/README -> README.txt.

  compact.

- Fix crash in itertools.cycle.__setstate__() when the first argument wasn't
  a list.

IDLE
----

- bpo-20640: Add tests for idlelib.configHelpSourceEdit. Patch by Saimadhav
  Heblikar.

- In the 'IDLE-console differences' section of the IDLE doc, clarify how
  running with IDLE affects sys.modules and the standard streams.

- bpo-25507: fix incorrect change in IOBinding that prevented printing.
  Augment IOBinding htest to include all major IOBinding functions.

- bpo-25905: Revert unwanted conversion of ' to ’ RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION
  MARK in README.txt and open this and NEWS.txt with 'ascii'. Re-encode
  CREDITS.txt to utf-8 and open it with 'utf-8'.

- bpo-15348: Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.

- bpo-24455: Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.

- Change 'The program' to 'Your program' in an IDLE 'kill program?' message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

- bpo-24750: Improve the appearance of the IDLE editor window status bar.
  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-25313: Change the handling of new built-in text color themes to better
  address the compatibility problem introduced by the addition of IDLE Dark.
  Consistently use the revised idleConf.CurrentTheme everywhere in idlelib.

- bpo-24782: Extension configuration is now a tab in the IDLE Preferences
  dialog rather than a separate dialog.  The former tabs are now a sorted
  list.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-22726: Re-activate the config dialog help button with some content
  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.

- bpo-24820: IDLE now has an 'IDLE Dark' built-in text color theme. It is
  more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, ... are still green, red, orange, ... . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the 'Save as New
  Custom Theme' button and enter a new name, such as 'Custom Dark'.  The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.

- bpo-25224: README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  'IDLE' now means 'Integrated Development and Learning Environment'.

- bpo-24820: Users can now set breakpoint colors in Settings -> Custom
  Highlighting. Original patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24972: Inactive selection background now matches active selection
  background, as configured by users, on all systems.  Found items are now
  always highlighted on Windows.  Initial patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24570: Idle: make calltip and completion boxes appear on Macs affected
  by a tk regression.  Initial patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24988: Idle ScrolledList context menus (used in debugger) now work on
  Mac Aqua. Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-24801: Make right-click for context menu work on Mac Aqua. Patch by
  Mark Roseman.

- bpo-25173: Associate tkinter messageboxes with a specific widget. For Mac
  OSX, make them a 'sheet'.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-25198: Enhance the initial html viewer now used for Idle Help.
  Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman). Give code
  snippet a very Sphinx-like light blueish-gray background. Re-use initial
  width and height set by users for shell and editor. When the Table of
  Contents (TOC) menu is used, put the section header at the top of the
  screen.

- bpo-25225: Condense and rewrite Idle doc section on text colors.

- bpo-21995: Explain some differences between IDLE and console Python.

- bpo-22820: Explain need for *print* when running file from Idle editor.

- bpo-25224: Doc: augment Idle feature list and no-subprocess section.

- bpo-25219: Update doc for Idle command line options. Some were missing and
  notes were not correct.

- bpo-24861: Most of idlelib is private and subject to change. Use
  idleib.idle.* to start Idle. See idlelib.__init__.__doc__.

- bpo-25199: Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.

- bpo-16893: Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new
  idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks
  better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The
  tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Rose Roseman.
  The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are
  deprecated.

- bpo-24199: Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.

- bpo-24790: Remove extraneous code (which also create 2 & 3 conflicts).

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-26736: Used HTTPS for external links in the documentation if possible.

- bpo-26325: Added test.support.check_no_resource_warning() to check that no
  ResourceWarning is emitted.

- bpo-25940: Changed test_ssl to use its internal local server more.  This
  avoids relying on svn.python.org, which recently changed root certificate.

- bpo-25616: Tests for OrderedDict are extracted from test_collections into
  separate file test_ordered_dict.

- bpo-25449: Added tests for OrderedDict subclasses.

- bpo-25188: Add -P/--pgo to test.regrtest to suppress error output when
  running the test suite for the purposes of a PGO build. Initial patch by

  via macros (in particular on Android).  Patch by Chi Hsuan Yen.

- bpo-22359: Disable the rules for running _freeze_importlib and pgen when
  cross-compiling.  The output of these programs is normally saved with the
  source code anyway, and is still regenerated when doing a native build.
  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-21668: Link audioop, _datetime, _ctypes_test modules to libm, except
  on Mac OS X. Patch written by Chi Hsuan Yen.

- bpo-25702: A --with-lto configure option has been added that will enable
  link time optimizations at build time during a make profile-opt. Some
  compilers and toolchains are known to not produce stable code when using
  LTO, be sure to test things thoroughly before relying on it. It can
  provide a few % speed up over profile-opt alone.

- bpo-26624: Adds validation of ucrtbase[d].dll version with warning for old

  Previously it could fail to compile properly if the math and cmath builds
  were concurrent.

- bpo-26465: Update OS X 10.5+ 32-bit-only installer to build and link with
  OpenSSL 1.0.2g.

- bpo-26268: Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2f.

- bpo-25136: Support Apple Xcode 7's new textual SDK stub libraries.

  is loaded, but get C types on demand. The C types can change if
  python-gdb.py is loaded before the Python executable. Patch written by
  Thomas Ilsche.

- bpo-26271: Fix the Freeze tool to properly use flags passed through
  configure. Patch by Daniel Shaulov.

What's New in Python 3.5.5 final?
=================================

*Release date: 2018-02-04*

There were no new changes in version 3.5.5.



What's New in Python 3.5.5 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2018-01-23*

Security
--------

- bpo-32551: The ``sys.path[0]`` initialization change for bpo-29139 caused
  a regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized
  when executing ``__main__`` from a zipfile, directory, or other import
  location. This is considered a potential security issue, as it may lead to
  privileged processes unexpectedly loading code from user controlled
  directories in situations where that was not previously the case.

  The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import location's
  parent directory to ``sys.path``, and ensures no other ``sys.path``
  entries are inadvertently modified when inserting the import location
  named on the command line. (Originally reported as bpo-29723 against
  Python 3.6rc1, but it was missed at the time that the then upcoming Python
  3.5.4 release would also be affected)

- bpo-30657: Fixed possible integer overflow in PyBytes_DecodeEscape,
  CVE-2017-1000158. Original patch by Jay Bosamiya; rebased to Python 3 by
  Miro Hrončok.

- bpo-30947: Upgrade libexpat embedded copy from version 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 to
  get security fixes.

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-31095: Fix potential crash during GC caused by ``tp_dealloc`` which
  doesn't call ``PyObject_GC_UnTrack()``.

Library
-------

- bpo-32072: Fixed issues with binary plists:

  * Fixed saving bytearrays.
  * Identical objects will be saved only once.
  * Equal references will be load as identical objects.
  * Added support for saving and loading recursive data structures.

- bpo-31170: expat: Update libexpat from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4. Fix copying of
  partial characters for UTF-8 input (libexpat bug 115):
  https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/115


What's New in Python 3.5.4 final?
=================================

*Release date: 2017-08-07*

Library
-------

- bpo-30119: ftplib.FTP.putline() now throws ValueError on commands that
  contains CR or LF. Patch by Dong-hee Na.


What's New in Python 3.5.4 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2017-07-23*

Security
--------

- bpo-30730: Prevent environment variables injection in subprocess on
  Windows.  Prevent passing other environment variables and command
  arguments.

- bpo-30694: Upgrade expat copy from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 to get fixes of multiple
  security vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity
  infinite loop DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix),
  CVE-2016-0718 (Fix regression bugs from 2.2.0's fix to CVE-2016-0718) and
  CVE-2012-0876 (Counter hash flooding with SipHash). Note: the
  CVE-2016-5300 (Use os-specific entropy sources like getrandom) doesn't
  impact Python, since Python already gets entropy from the OS to set the
  expat secret using ``XML_SetHashSalt()``.

- bpo-30500: Fix urllib.parse.splithost() to correctly parse fragments. For
  example, ``splithost('//127.0.0.1#@evil.com/')`` now correctly returns the
  ``127.0.0.1`` host, instead of treating ``@evil.com`` as the host in an
  authentication (``login@host``).

- bpo-29591: Update expat copy from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 to get fixes of
  CVE-2016-0718 and CVE-2016-4472. See
  https://sourceforge.net/p/expat/bugs/537/ for more information.

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-30876: Relative import from unloaded package now reimports the package
  instead of failing with SystemError.  Relative import from non-package now
  fails with ImportError rather than SystemError.

- bpo-30765: Avoid blocking in pthread_mutex_lock() when
  PyThread_acquire_lock() is asked not to block.

- bpo-27945: Fixed various segfaults with dict when input collections are
  mutated during searching, inserting or comparing.  Based on patches by
  Duane Griffin and Tim Mitchell.

- bpo-25794: Fixed type.__setattr__() and type.__delattr__() for
  non-interned attribute names.  Based on patch by Eryk Sun.

- bpo-29935: Fixed error messages in the index() method of tuple, list and
  deque when pass indices of wrong type.

- bpo-28876: ``bool(range)`` works even if ``len(range)`` raises
  :exc:`OverflowError`.

- bpo-29600: Fix wrapping coroutine return values in StopIteration.

- bpo-29537: Restore runtime compatibility with bytecode files generated by
  CPython 3.5.0 to 3.5.2, and adjust the eval loop to avoid the problems
  that could be caused by the malformed variant of the
  BUILD_MAP_UNPACK_WITH_CALL opcode that they may contain. Patch by Petr
  Viktorin, Serhiy Storchaka, and Nick Coghlan.

- bpo-28598: Support __rmod__ for subclasses of str being called before
  str.__mod__. Patch by Martijn Pieters.

- bpo-29602: Fix incorrect handling of signed zeros in complex constructor
  for complex subclasses and for inputs having a __complex__ method. Patch
  by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-29347: Fixed possibly dereferencing undefined pointers when creating
  weakref objects.

- bpo-29438: Fixed use-after-free problem in key sharing dict.

Library
-------

- bpo-29403: Fix ``unittest.mock``'s autospec to not fail on method-bound
  builtin functions.  Patch by Aaron Gallagher.

- bpo-30961: Fix decrementing a borrowed reference in tracemalloc.

- bpo-30886: Fix multiprocessing.Queue.join_thread(): it now waits until the
  thread completes, even if the thread was started by the same process which
  created the queue.

- bpo-29854: Fix segfault in readline when using readline's history-size
  option.  Patch by Nir Soffer.

- bpo-30807: signal.setitimer() may disable the timer when passed a tiny
  value.

  Tiny values (such as 1e-6) are valid non-zero values for setitimer(),
  which is specified as taking microsecond-resolution intervals. However, on
  some platform, our conversion routine could convert 1e-6 into a zero
  interval, therefore disabling the timer instead of (re-)scheduling it.

- bpo-30441: Fix bug when modifying os.environ while iterating over it

- bpo-30532: Fix email header value parser dropping folding white space in
  certain cases.

- bpo-29169: Update zlib to 1.2.11.

- bpo-29755: Fixed the lgettext() family of functions in the gettext module.
  They now always return bytes.

- bpo-30645: Fix path calculation in imp.load_package(), fixing it for cases

  Ardelean.

- bpo-23890: unittest.TestCase.assertRaises() now manually breaks a
  reference cycle to not keep objects alive longer than expected.

- bpo-30149: inspect.signature() now supports callables with
  variable-argument parameters wrapped with partialmethod. Patch by Dong-hee
  Na.

- bpo-29931: Fixed comparison check for ipaddress.ip_interface objects.

  (code 10022) on shutdown(SHUT_RDWR): An invalid operation was attempted.
  This error occurs sometimes on SSL connections.

- bpo-30375: Warnings emitted when compile a regular expression now always
  point to the line in the user code.  Previously they could point into
  inners of the re module if emitted from inside of groups or conditionals.

- bpo-30048: Fixed ``Task.cancel()`` can be ignored when the task is running
  coroutine and the coroutine returned without any more ``await``.

- bpo-29990: Fix range checking in GB18030 decoder.  Original patch by Ma

  :issue:`30523`), --matchfile (load a list of test filters from a text
  file, :issue:`30540`), --slowest (alias to --slow).

  up caches, create explicitly all internal singletons which are created on
  demand to prevent false positives when checking for reference leaks.
  (:issue:`30675`).

  clause, if there is one.

- bpo-29571: to match the behaviour of the ``re.LOCALE`` flag,
  test_re.test_locale_flag now uses ``locale.getpreferredencoding(False)``

  correctly skip the test when the default locale encoding is a multi-byte
  encoding)

  a contextlib.ExitStack() and one of the exit stack generators catches and
  raises it in a chain, do not re-raise the original exception when exiting,
  let the new chained one through.  This avoids the PEP 479 bug described in
  issue25782.

What's New in Python 3.5.2 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2016-06-12*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-27066: Fixed SystemError if a custom opener (for open()) returns a
  negative number without setting an exception.

- bpo-20041: Fixed TypeError when frame.f_trace is set to None. Patch by
  Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-26168: Fixed possible refleaks in failing Py_BuildValue() with the "N"
  format unit.

- bpo-26991: Fix possible refleak when creating a function with annotations.

- bpo-27039: Fixed bytearray.remove() for values greater than 127.  Patch by
  Joe Jevnik.

- bpo-23640: int.from_bytes() no longer bypasses constructors for
  subclasses.

- bpo-26811: gc.get_objects() no longer contains a broken tuple with NULL
  pointer.

- bpo-20120: Use RawConfigParser for .pypirc parsing, removing support for
  interpolation unintentionally added with move to Python 3. Behavior no
  longer does any interpolation in .pypirc files, matching behavior in
  Python 2.7 and Setuptools 19.0.

- bpo-26659: Make the builtin slice type support cycle collection.

- bpo-26718: super.__init__ no longer leaks memory if called multiple times.
  NOTE: A direct call of super.__init__ is not endorsed!

- bpo-25339: PYTHONIOENCODING now has priority over locale in setting the
  error handler for stdin and stdout.

- bpo-26494: Fixed crash on iterating exhausting iterators. Affected classes
  are generic sequence iterators, iterators of str, bytes, bytearray, list,
  tuple, set, frozenset, dict, OrderedDict, corresponding views and
  os.scandir() iterator.

- bpo-26581: If coding cookie is specified multiple times on a line in
  Python source code file, only the first one is taken to account.

- bpo-26464: Fix str.translate() when string is ASCII and first replacements
  removes character, but next replacement uses a non-ASCII character or a
  string longer than 1 character. Regression introduced in Python 3.5.0.

- bpo-22836: Ensure exception reports from PyErr_Display() and
  PyErr_WriteUnraisable() are sensible even when formatting them produces
  secondary errors.  This affects the reports produced by
  sys.__excepthook__() and when __del__() raises an exception.

- bpo-26302: Correct behavior to reject comma as a legal character for
  cookie names.

- bpo-4806: Avoid masking the original TypeError exception when using star
  (``*``) unpacking in function calls.  Based on patch by Hagen Fürstenau
  and Daniel Urban.

- bpo-27138: Fix the doc comment for FileFinder.find_spec().

- bpo-26154: Add a new private _PyThreadState_UncheckedGet() function to get
  the current Python thread state, but don't issue a fatal error if it is
  NULL. This new function must be used instead of accessing directly the
  _PyThreadState_Current variable.  The variable is no more exposed since
  Python 3.5.1 to hide the exact implementation of atomic C types, to avoid
  compiler issues.

- bpo-26194: Deque.insert() gave odd results for bounded deques that had
  reached their maximum size.  Now an IndexError will be raised when
  attempting to insert into a full deque.

- bpo-25843: When compiling code, don't merge constants if they are equal
  but have a different types. For example, ``f1, f2 = lambda: 1, lambda:
  1.0`` is now correctly compiled to two different functions: ``f1()``
  returns ``1`` (``int``) and ``f2()`` returns ``1.0`` (``int``), even if
  ``1`` and ``1.0`` are equal.

- bpo-22995: [UPDATE] Comment out the one of the pickleability tests in
  _PyObject_GetState() due to regressions observed in Cython-based projects.

- bpo-25961: Disallowed null characters in the type name.

- bpo-25973: Fix segfault when an invalid nonlocal statement binds a name
  starting with two underscores.

- bpo-22995: Instances of extension types with a state that aren't
  subclasses of list or dict and haven't implemented any pickle-related
  methods (__reduce__, __reduce_ex__, __getnewargs__, __getnewargs_ex__, or
  __getstate__), can no longer be pickled.  Including memoryview.

- bpo-20440: Massive replacing unsafe attribute setting code with special
  macro Py_SETREF.

- bpo-25766: Special method __bytes__() now works in str subclasses.

- bpo-25421: __sizeof__ methods of builtin types now use dynamic basic size.
  This allows sys.getsize() to work correctly with their subclasses with
  __slots__ defined.

- bpo-25709: Fixed problem with in-place string concatenation and utf-8
  cache.

- bpo-27147: Mention PEP 420 in the importlib docs.

- bpo-24097: Fixed crash in object.__reduce__() if slot name is freed inside
  __getattr__.

- bpo-24731: Fixed crash on converting objects with special methods
  __bytes__, __trunc__, and __float__ returning instances of subclasses of
  bytes, int, and float to subclasses of bytes, int, and float
  correspondingly.

- bpo-26478: Fix semantic bugs when using binary operators with dictionary
  views and tuples.

- bpo-26171: Fix possible integer overflow and heap corruption in
  zipimporter.get_data().

- bpo-25660: Fix TAB key behaviour in REPL with readline.

- bpo-25887: Raise a RuntimeError when a coroutine object is awaited more
  than once.

- bpo-27243: Update the __aiter__ protocol: instead of returning an
  awaitable that resolves to an asynchronous iterator, the asynchronous
  iterator should be returned directly.  Doing the former will trigger a
  PendingDeprecationWarning.

  Type[], NewType(), TYPE_CHECKING, and numerous bug fixes (note that some
  of the new features are not yet implemented in mypy or other static
  analyzers). Also classes for PEP 492 (Awaitable, AsyncIterable,
  AsyncIterator) have been added (in fact they made it into 3.5.1 but were
  never mentioned).

- bpo-25738: Stop http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.send_error() from
  sending a message body for 205 Reset Content.  Also, don't send Content

  with a predefined zdict.  Based on patch by Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-24291: Fix wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler to completely
  write data to the client.  Previously it could do partial writes and
  truncate data.  Also, wsgiref.handler.ServerHandler can now handle stdout
  doing partial writes, but this is deprecated.

- bpo-26809: Add ``__all__`` to :mod:`string`.  Patch by Emanuel Barry.

- bpo-14132: Fix urllib.request redirect handling when the target only has a
  query string.  Original fix by Ján Janech.

- bpo-17214: The "urllib.request" module now percent-encodes non-ASCII bytes
  found in redirect target URLs.  Some servers send Location header fields
  with non-ASCII bytes, but "http.client" requires the request target to be
  ASCII-encodable, otherwise a UnicodeEncodeError is raised.  Based on patch
  by Christian Heimes.

- bpo-26892: Honor debuglevel flag in urllib.request.HTTPHandler. Patch
  contributed by Chi Hsuan Yen.

  instead of silently return incorrect result.

- bpo-26711: Fixed the comparison of plistlib.Data with other types.

- bpo-24114: Fix an uninitialized variable in `ctypes.util`.

  The bug only occurs on SunOS when the ctypes implementation searches for
  the `crle` program.  Patch by Xiang Zhang.  Tested on SunOS by Kees Bos.

- bpo-26864: In urllib.request, change the proxy bypass host checking
  against no_proxy to be case-insensitive, and to not match unrelated host
  names that happen to have a bypassed hostname as a suffix.  Patch by Xiang
  Zhang.

- bpo-26634: recursive_repr() now sets __qualname__ of wrapper.  Patch by
  Xiang Zhang.

  messages of platform.dist() and platform.linux_distribution(). Patch by
  Kumaripaba Miyurusara Athukorala.

  to always return False.

- bpo-25195: Fix a regression in mock.MagicMock. _Call is a subclass of

  gethostbyname_ex() functions of the socket module now decode the hostname
  from the ANSI code page rather than UTF-8.

- bpo-26147: xmlrpc now works with strings not encodable with used non-UTF-8
  encoding.

- bpo-25935: Garbage collector now breaks reference loops with OrderedDict.

  original values after patching. Patch contributed by Sean McCully.

- bpo-25672: In the ssl module, enable the SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS mode
  option if it is safe to do so.

- bpo-26012: Don't traverse into symlinks for ``**`` pattern in
  pathlib.Path.[r]glob().

- bpo-24120: Ignore PermissionError when traversing a tree with
  pathlib.Path.[r]glob(). Patch by Ulrich Petri.

- bpo-25447: fileinput now uses sys.stdin as-is if it does not have a buffer
  attribute (restores backward compatibility).

- bpo-25447: Copying the lru_cache() wrapper object now always works,
  independently from the type of the wrapped object (by returning the
  original object unchanged).

- bpo-24103: Fixed possible use after free in ElementTree.XMLPullParser.

- bpo-25902: Fixed various refcount issues in ElementTree iteration.

- bpo-25717: Restore the previous behaviour of tolerating most fstat()
  errors when opening files.  This was a regression in 3.5a1, and stopped
  anonymous temporary files from working in special cases.

- bpo-24903: Fix regression in number of arguments compileall accepts when
  '-d' is specified.  The check on the number of arguments has been dropped
  completely as it never worked correctly anyway.

- bpo-25764: In the subprocess module, preserve any exception caused by
  fork() failure when preexec_fn is used.

- bpo-6478: _strptime's regexp cache now is reset after changing timezone
  with time.tzset().

- bpo-14285: When executing a package with the "python -m package" option,
  and package initialization fails, a proper traceback is now reported.  The
  "runpy" module now lets exceptions from package initialization pass back
  to the caller, rather than raising ImportError.

- bpo-19771: Also in runpy and the "-m" option, omit the irrelevant message
  ". . . is a package and cannot be directly executed" if the package could
  not even be initialized (e.g. due to a bad ``*.pyc`` file).

- bpo-25177: Fixed problem with the mean of very small and very large
  numbers. As a side effect, statistics.mean and statistics.variance should
  be significantly faster.

- bpo-22970: asyncio: Fix inconsistency cancelling Condition.wait. Patch by
  David Coles.

IDLE
----

- bpo-5124: Paste with text selected now replaces the selection on X11. This
  matches how paste works on Windows, Mac, most modern Linux apps, and ttk
  widgets. Original patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

- bpo-24759: Make clear in idlelib.idle_test.__init__ that the directory is
  a private implementation of test.test_idle and tool for maintainers.

- bpo-27196: Stop 'ThemeChanged' warnings when running IDLE tests. These

  additional advice in idle_test/README.txt

- bpo-20567: Revise idle_test/README.txt with advice about avoiding tk
  warning messages from tests.  Apply advice to several IDLE tests.

- bpo-27117: Make colorizer htest and turtledemo work with dark themes. Move
  code for configuring text widget colors to a new function.

- bpo-26673: When tk reports font size as 0, change to size 10. Such fonts
  on Linux prevented the configuration dialog from opening.

- bpo-21939: Add test for IDLE's percolator. Original patch by Saimadhav
  Heblikar.

- bpo-21676: Add test for IDLE's replace dialog. Original patch by Saimadhav

  Augment IOBinding htest to include all major IOBinding functions.

- bpo-25905: Revert unwanted conversion of ' to ’ RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION
  MARK in README.txt and open this and NEWS.txt with 'ascii'. Re-encode
  CREDITS.txt to utf-8 and open it with 'utf-8'.

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-19489: Moved the search box from the sidebar to the header and footer
  of each page. Patch by Ammar Askar.

  separate file test_ordered_dict.

- bpo-26583: Skip test_timestamp_overflow in test_import if bytecode files
  cannot be written.

Build
-----

- bpo-26884: Fix linking extension modules for cross builds. Patch by Xavier
  de Gaye.

- bpo-22359: Disable the rules for running _freeze_importlib and pgen when
  cross-compiling.  The output of these programs is normally saved with the
  source code anyway, and is still regenerated when doing a native build.
  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-27229: Fix the cross-compiling pgen rule for in-tree builds.  Patch by
  Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-21668: Link audioop, _datetime, _ctypes_test modules to libm, except
  on Mac OS X. Patch written by Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-25702: A --with-lto configure option has been added that will enable
  link time optimizations at build time during a make profile-opt. Some
  compilers and toolchains are known to not produce stable code when using
  LTO, be sure to test things thoroughly before relying on it. It can
  provide a few % speed up over profile-opt alone.

- bpo-26624: Adds validation of ucrtbase[d].dll version with warning for old
  versions.

- bpo-17603: Avoid error about nonexistant fileblocks.o file by using a

  Previously it could fail to compile properly if the math and cmath builds
  were concurrent.

- bpo-25348: Added ``--pgo`` and ``--pgo-job`` arguments to
  ``PCbuild\build.bat`` for building with Profile-Guided Optimization.  The
  old ``PCbuild\build_pgo.bat`` script is now deprecated, and simply calls
  ``PCbuild\build.bat --pgo %*``.

- bpo-25827: Add support for building with ICC to ``configure``, including a
  new ``--with-icc`` flag.

- bpo-25696: Fix installation of Python on UNIX with make -j9.

- bpo-26930: Update OS X 10.5+ 32-bit-only installer to build and link with
  OpenSSL 1.0.2h.

- bpo-26268: Update Windows builds to use OpenSSL 1.0.2f.

- bpo-25136: Support Apple Xcode 7's new textual SDK stub libraries.

  option does not work correctly in older versions of gcc and has been
  silently removed as of gcc-4.5.

Windows
-------

- bpo-27053: Updates make_zip.py to correctly generate library ZIP file.

- bpo-26268: Update the prepare_ssl.py script to handle OpenSSL releases
  that don't include the contents of the include directory (that is, 1.0.2e
  and later).

- bpo-26071: bdist_wininst created binaries fail to start and find 32bit
  Python

- bpo-26073: Update the list of magic numbers in launcher

- bpo-26065: Excludes venv from library when generating embeddable distro.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-26799: Fix python-gdb.py: don't get C types once when the Python code
  is loaded, but get C types on demand. The C types can change if
  python-gdb.py is loaded before the Python executable. Patch written by
  Thomas Ilsche.

- bpo-26271: Fix the Freeze tool to properly use flags passed through
  configure. Patch by Daniel Shaulov.

What's New in Python 3.5.1 final?
=================================

*Release date: 2015-12-06*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-25709: Fixed problem with in-place string concatenation and utf-8
  cache.

Windows
-------

- bpo-25715: Python 3.5.1 installer shows wrong upgrade path and incorrect
  logic for launcher detection.


What's New in Python 3.5.1 release candidate 1?
===============================================

*Release date: 2015-11-22*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-25630: Fix a possible segfault during argument parsing in functions
  that accept filesystem paths.

- bpo-23564: Fixed a partially broken sanity check in the _posixsubprocess
  internals regarding how fds_to_pass were passed to the child.  The bug had
  no actual impact as subprocess.py already avoided it.

- bpo-25388: Fixed tokenizer crash when processing undecodable source code
  with a null byte.

- bpo-25462: The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most
  operations in C implementation of OrderedDict.

- bpo-22995: Default implementation of __reduce__ and __reduce_ex__ now
  rejects builtin types with not defined __new__.

- bpo-25555: Fix parser and AST: fill lineno and col_offset of "arg" node
  when compiling AST from Python objects.

- bpo-24802: Avoid buffer overreads when int(), float(), compile(), exec()
  and eval() are passed bytes-like objects.  These objects are not
  necessarily terminated by a null byte, but the functions assumed they
  were.

- bpo-24726: Fixed a crash and leaking NULL in repr() of OrderedDict that
  was mutated by direct calls of dict methods.

- bpo-25449: Iterating OrderedDict with keys with unstable hash now raises
  KeyError in C implementations as well as in Python implementation.

- bpo-25395: Fixed crash when highly nested OrderedDict structures were
  garbage collected.

- bpo-25274: sys.setrecursionlimit() now raises a RecursionError if the new
  recursion limit is too low depending at the current recursion depth.
  Modify also the "lower-water mark" formula to make it monotonic. This mark
  is used to decide when the overflowed flag of the thread state is reset.

- bpo-24402: Fix input() to prompt to the redirected stdout when
  sys.stdout.fileno() fails.

- bpo-24806: Prevent builtin types that are not allowed to be subclassed
  from being subclassed through multiple inheritance.

- bpo-24848: Fixed a number of bugs in UTF-7 decoding of misformed data.

- bpo-25280: Import trace messages emitted in verbose (-v) mode are no
  longer formatted twice.

- bpo-25003: On Solaris 11.3 or newer, os.urandom() now uses the getrandom()
  function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy() function
  is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom() doesn't
  need such high-quality entropy.

- bpo-25182: The stdprinter (used as sys.stderr before the io module is
  imported at startup) now uses the backslashreplace error handler.

- bpo-25131: Make the line number and column offset of set/dict literals and
  comprehensions correspond to the opening brace.

- bpo-25150: Hide the private _Py_atomic_xxx symbols from the public
  Python.h header to fix a compilation error with OpenMP.
  PyThreadState_GET() becomes an alias to PyThreadState_Get() to avoid ABI
  incompatibilities.

Library
-------

- bpo-25626: Change three zlib functions to accept sizes that fit in
  Py_ssize_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT_MAX.  This resolves a
  regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than
  2 or 4 GiB.  The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress()
  max_length parameter, the zlib.decompress() bufsize parameter, and the
  zlib.Decompress.flush() length parameter.

- bpo-25583: Avoid incorrect errors raised by os.makedirs(exist_ok=True)
  when the OS gives priority to errors such as EACCES over EEXIST.

- bpo-25593: Change semantics of EventLoop.stop() in asyncio.

- bpo-6973: When we know a subprocess.Popen process has died, do not allow
  the send_signal(), terminate(), or kill() methods to do anything as they
  could potentially signal a different process.

- bpo-25590: In the Readline completer, only call getattr() once per
  attribute.

- bpo-25498: Fix a crash when garbage-collecting ctypes objects created by
  wrapping a memoryview.  This was a regression made in 3.5a1.  Based on
  patch by Eryksun.

- bpo-25584: Added "escape" to the __all__ list in the glob module.

- bpo-25584: Fixed recursive glob() with patterns starting with ``**``.

- bpo-25446: Fix regression in smtplib's AUTH LOGIN support.

- bpo-18010: Fix the pydoc web server's module search function to handle
  exceptions from importing packages.

- bpo-25554: Got rid of circular references in regular expression parsing.

- bpo-25510: fileinput.FileInput.readline() now returns b'' instead of '' at
  the end if the FileInput was opened with binary mode. Patch by Ryosuke
  Ito.

- bpo-25503: Fixed inspect.getdoc() for inherited docstrings of properties.
  Original patch by John Mark Vandenberg.

- bpo-25515: Always use os.urandom as a source of randomness in uuid.uuid4.

- bpo-21827: Fixed textwrap.dedent() for the case when largest common
  whitespace is a substring of smallest leading whitespace. Based on patch
  by Robert Li.

- bpo-25447: The lru_cache() wrapper objects now can be copied and pickled
  (by returning the original object unchanged).

- bpo-25390: typing: Don't crash on Union[str, Pattern].

- bpo-25441: asyncio: Raise error from drain() when socket is closed.

- bpo-25410: Cleaned up and fixed minor bugs in C implementation of
  OrderedDict.

  the email package. Thanks to user simon04 for the patch.

- bpo-25407: Remove mentions of the formatter module being removed in Python
  3.6.

- bpo-25406: Fixed a bug in C implementation of OrderedDict.move_to_end()
  that caused segmentation fault or hang in iterating after moving several
  items to the start of ordered dict.

- bpo-25364: zipfile now works in threads disabled builds.

- bpo-25328: smtpd's SMTPChannel now correctly raises a ValueError if both
  decode_data and enable_SMTPUTF8 are set to true.

- bpo-25316: distutils raises OSError instead of DistutilsPlatformError when
  MSVC is not installed.

- bpo-25380: Fixed protocol for the STACK_GLOBAL opcode in
  pickletools.opcodes.

- bpo-23972: Updates asyncio datagram create method allowing reuseport and
  reuseaddr socket options to be set prior to binding the socket. Mirroring
  the existing asyncio create_server method the reuseaddr option for
  datagram sockets defaults to True if the O/S is 'posix' (except if the
  platform is Cygwin). Patch by Chris Laws.

- bpo-25304: Add asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe().  This lets you submit a
  coroutine to a loop from another thread, returning a
  concurrent.futures.Future.  By Vincent Michel.

- bpo-25232: Fix CGIRequestHandler to split the query from the URL at the
  first question mark (?) rather than the last. Patch from Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-24657: Prevent CGIRequestHandler from collapsing slashes in the query
  part of the URL as if it were a path. Patch from Xiang Zhang.

- bpo-24483: C implementation of functools.lru_cache() now calculates key's
  hash only once.

- bpo-22958: Constructor and update method of weakref.WeakValueDictionary
  now accept the self and the dict keyword arguments.

- bpo-22609: Constructor of collections.UserDict now accepts the self
  keyword argument.

- bpo-25111: Fixed comparison of traceback.FrameSummary.

- bpo-25262: Added support for BINBYTES8 opcode in Python implementation of
  unpickler. Highest 32 bits of 64-bit size for BINUNICODE8 and BINBYTES8
  opcodes no longer silently ignored on 32-bit platforms in C
  implementation.

- bpo-25034: Fix string.Formatter problem with auto-numbering and nested
  format_specs. Patch by Anthon van der Neut.

- bpo-25233: Rewrite the guts of asyncio.Queue and asyncio.Semaphore to be
  more understandable and correct.

- bpo-25203: Failed readline.set_completer_delims() no longer left the
  module in inconsistent state.

- bpo-23600: Default implementation of tzinfo.fromutc() was returning wrong
  results in some cases.

- bpo-23329: Allow the ssl module to be built with older versions of
  LibreSSL.

- Prevent overflow in _Unpickler_Read.

- bpo-25047: The XML encoding declaration written by Element Tree now
  respects the letter case given by the user. This restores the ability to
  write encoding names in uppercase like "UTF-8", which worked in Python 2.

- bpo-25135: Make deque_clear() safer by emptying the deque before clearing.
  This helps avoid possible reentrancy issues.

- bpo-19143: platform module now reads Windows version from kernel32.dll to
  avoid compatibility shims.

- bpo-25092: Fix datetime.strftime() failure when errno was already set to
  EINVAL.

- bpo-23517: Fix rounding in fromtimestamp() and utcfromtimestamp() methods
  of datetime.datetime: microseconds are now rounded to nearest with ties
  going to nearest even integer (ROUND_HALF_EVEN), instead of being rounding
  towards minus infinity (ROUND_FLOOR). It's important that these methods
  use the same rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) ==
  datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t). It also the rounding mode used by
  round(float) for example.

- bpo-25155: Fix datetime.datetime.now() and datetime.datetime.utcnow() on
  Windows to support date after year 2038. It was a regression introduced in
  Python 3.5.0.

- bpo-25108: Omitted internal frames in traceback functions print_stack(),
  format_stack(), and extract_stack() called without arguments.

- bpo-25118: Fix a regression of Python 3.5.0 in os.waitpid() on Windows.

- bpo-24684: socket.socket.getaddrinfo() now calls
  PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() instead of calling the encode() method of the
  host, to handle correctly custom string with an encode() method which
  doesn't return a byte string. The encoder of the IDNA codec is now called
  directly instead of calling the encode() method of the string.

- bpo-25060: Correctly compute stack usage of the BUILD_MAP opcode.

- bpo-24857: Comparing call_args to a long sequence now correctly returns a
  boolean result instead of raising an exception.  Patch by A Kaptur.

- bpo-23144: Make sure that HTMLParser.feed() returns all the data, even
  when convert_charrefs is True.

- bpo-24982: shutil.make_archive() with the "zip" format now adds entries
  for directories (including empty directories) in ZIP file.

- bpo-25019: Fixed a crash caused by setting non-string key of expat parser.
  Based on patch by John Leitch.

- bpo-16180: Exit pdb if file has syntax error, instead of trapping user in
  an infinite loop.  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.

- bpo-24891: Fix a race condition at Python startup if the file descriptor
  of stdin (0), stdout (1) or stderr (2) is closed while Python is creating
  sys.stdin, sys.stdout and sys.stderr objects. These attributes are now set
  to None if the creation of the object failed, instead of raising an
  OSError exception. Initial patch written by Marco Paolini.

- bpo-24992: Fix error handling and a race condition (related to garbage
  collection) in collections.OrderedDict constructor.

- bpo-24881: Fixed setting binary mode in Python implementation of FileIO on
  Windows and Cygwin.  Patch from Akira Li.

- bpo-25578: Fix (another) memory leak in SSLSocket.getpeercer().

- bpo-25530: Disable the vulnerable SSLv3 protocol by default when creating
  ssl.SSLContext.

- bpo-25569: Fix memory leak in SSLSocket.getpeercert().

- bpo-25471: Sockets returned from accept() shouldn't appear to be
  nonblocking.

- bpo-25319: When threading.Event is reinitialized, the underlying condition
  should use a regular lock rather than a recursive lock.

- bpo-21112: Fix regression in unittest.expectedFailure on subclasses. Patch
  from Berker Peksag.

- bpo-24764: cgi.FieldStorage.read_multi() now ignores the Content-Length
  header in part headers. Patch written by Peter Landry and reviewed by
  Pierre Quentel.

- bpo-24913: Fix overrun error in deque.index(). Found by John Leitch and
  Bryce Darling.

- bpo-24774: Fix docstring in http.server.test. Patch from Chiu-Hsiang Hsu.

- bpo-21159: Improve message in
  configparser.InterpolationMissingOptionError. Patch from Łukasz Langa.

- bpo-20362: Honour TestCase.longMessage correctly in assertRegex. Patch
  from Ilia Kurenkov.

- bpo-23572: Fixed functools.singledispatch on classes with falsy
  metaclasses.  Patch by Ethan Furman.

- asyncio: ensure_future() now accepts awaitable objects.

IDLE
----

- bpo-15348: Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process) before
  closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process). This prevents
  the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.

- bpo-24455: Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455). The
  patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes. 1. Suspend and
  resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait mechanism intended
  for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit). 2. In gui.run, allow
  any existing interaction to terminate first.

- Change 'The program' to 'Your program' in an IDLE 'kill program?' message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

- bpo-24750: Improve the appearance of the IDLE editor window status bar.
  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-25313: Change the handling of new built-in text color themes to better
  address the compatibility problem introduced by the addition of IDLE Dark.
  Consistently use the revised idleConf.CurrentTheme everywhere in idlelib.

  dialog rather than a separate dialog.  The former tabs are now a sorted
  list.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- bpo-22726: Re-activate the config dialog help button with some content
  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.

- bpo-24820: IDLE now has an 'IDLE Dark' built-in text color theme. It is

  Strings, comments, keywords, ... are still green, red, orange, ... . To
  use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the 'Save as New
  Custom Theme' button and enter a new name, such as 'Custom Dark'.  The
  custom theme will work with any IDLE release, and can be modified.

- bpo-25224: README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users. The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  'IDLE' now means 'Integrated Development and Learning Environment'.

- bpo-23500: Argument Clinic is now smarter about generating the "#ifndef"
  (empty) definition of the methoddef macro: it's only generated once, even
  if Argument Clinic processes the same symbol multiple times, and it's
  emitted at the end of all processing rather than immediately after the
  first use.

C API
-----

- bpo-23998: PyImport_ReInitLock() now checks for lock allocation error


What's New in Python 3.5.0 alpha 3?

  objects.

Library
-------

- bpo-23775: pprint() of OrderedDict now outputs the same representation as
  repr().

- bpo-23765: Removed IsBadStringPtr calls in ctypes

  supports copying of instances of classes whose __new__ method takes
  keyword-only arguments.

- bpo-23491: Added a zipapp module to support creating executable zip file
  archives of Python code. Registered ".pyz" and ".pyzw" extensions on
  Windows for these archives (PEP 441).

- bpo-23657: Avoid explicit checks for str in zipapp, adding support for
  pathlib.Path objects as arguments.

- bpo-23688: Added support of arbitrary bytes-like objects and avoided
  unnecessary copying of memoryview in gzip.GzipFile.write(). Original patch
  by Wolfgang Maier.

  and socket open until the garbage collector cleans them up.  Patch by
  Martin Panter.

  insert(), and copy().  This allows deques to be registered as a
  MutableSequence and it improves their substitutability for lists.

- bpo-23715: :func:`signal.sigwaitinfo` and :func:`signal.sigtimedwait` are
  now retried when interrupted by a signal not in the *sigset* parameter, if
  the signal handler does not raise an exception. signal.sigtimedwait()
  recomputes the timeout with a monotonic clock when it is retried.

- bpo-23001: Few functions in modules mmap, ossaudiodev, socket, ssl, and
  codecs, that accepted only read-only bytes-like object now accept writable
  bytes-like object too.

- bpo-23646: If time.sleep() is interrupted by a signal, the sleep is now
  retried with the recomputed delay, except if the signal handler raises an
  exception (PEP 475).

- bpo-23136: _strptime now uniformly handles all days in week 0, including
  Dec 30 of previous year.  Based on patch by Jim Carroll.

- bpo-23700: Iterator of NamedTemporaryFile now keeps a reference to

- bpo-22903: The fake test case created by unittest.loader when it fails
  importing a test module is now picklable.

- bpo-22181: On Linux, os.urandom() now uses the new getrandom() syscall if
  available, syscall introduced in the Linux kernel 3.17. It is more
  reliable and more secure, because it avoids the need of a file descriptor
  and waits until the kernel has enough entropy.

- bpo-2211: Updated the implementation of the http.cookies.Morsel class.
  Setting attributes key, value and coded_value directly now is deprecated.
  update() and setdefault() now transform and check keys.  Comparing for
  equality now takes into account attributes key, value and coded_value.
  copy() now returns a Morsel, not a dict.  repr() now contains all
  attributes. Optimized checking keys and quoting values.  Added new tests.
  Original patch by Demian Brecht.

- bpo-23566: enable(), register(), dump_traceback() and
  dump_traceback_later() functions of faulthandler now accept file
  descriptors. Patch by Wei Wu.

  by Demian Brecht.

- bpo-23615: Modules bz2, tarfile and tokenize now can be reloaded with
  imp.reload(). Patch by Thomas Kluyver.

- bpo-23605: os.walk() now calls os.scandir() instead of os.listdir(). The
  usage of os.scandir() reduces the number of calls to os.stat(). Initial
  patch written by Ben Hoyt.

Build
-----

- bpo-23585: make patchcheck will ensure the interpreter is built.

Tests
-----

- bpo-23583: Added tests for standard IO streams in IDLE.

- bpo-22289: Prevent test_urllib2net failures due to ftp connection timeout.

  selection or control(command) '-' or '+' or control-mousewheel. Original
  patch by Lita Cho.

  OS may read less bytes than the number of requested bytes.

- bpo-21942: Fixed source file viewing in pydoc's server mode on Windows.

- bpo-11259: asynchat.async_chat().set_terminator() now raises a ValueError

- bpo-20574: Implement incremental decoder for cp65001 code (Windows code
  page 65001, Microsoft UTF-8).

- bpo-20879: Delay the initialization of encoding and decoding tables for
  base32, ascii85 and base85 codecs in the base64 module, and delay the
  initialization of the unquote_to_bytes() table of the urllib.parse module,
  to not waste memory if these modules are not used.

- bpo-19157: Include the broadcast address in the usuable hosts for IPv6 in
  ipaddress.

- bpo-11599: When an external command (e.g. compiler) fails, distutils now
  prints out the whole command line (instead of just the command name) if
  the environment variable DISTUTILS_DEBUG is set.

- bpo-4931: distutils should not produce unhelpful "error: None" messages
  anymore. distutils.util.grok_environment_error is kept but doc-deprecated.

- bpo-20875: Prevent possible gzip "'read' is not defined" NameError. Patch
  by Claudiu Popa.

  patches by Hirokazu Yamamoto and Amaury Forgeot d'Arc, with suggested
  wording by David Gutteridge)

- bpo-21117: Fix inspect.signature to better support functools.partial. Due
  to the specifics of functools.partial implementation,
  positional-or-keyword arguments passed as keyword arguments become
  keyword-only.

- bpo-20334: inspect.Signature and inspect.Parameter are now hashable.
  Thanks to Antony Lee for bug reports and suggestions.

- bpo-15916: doctest.DocTestSuite returns an empty unittest.TestSuite

IDLE
----

- bpo-20577: Configuration of the max line length for the FormatParagraph
  extension has been moved from the General tab of the Idle preferences
  dialog to the FormatParagraph tab of the Config Extensions dialog. Patch
  by Tal Einat.

- bpo-16893: Update Idle doc chapter to match current Idle and add new
  information.

- bpo-3068: Add Idle extension configuration dialog to Options menu. Changes
  are written to HOME/.idlerc/config-extensions.cfg. Original patch by Tal
  Einat.

- bpo-16233: A module browser (File : Class Browser, Alt+C) requires an
  editor window with a filename.  When Class Browser is requested otherwise,
  from a shell, output window, or 'Untitled' editor, Idle no longer displays
  an error box. It now pops up an Open Module box (Alt+M). If a valid name
  is entered and a module is opened, a corresponding browser is also opened.

- bpo-4832: Save As to type Python files automatically adds .py to the name
  you enter (even if your system does not display it).  Some systems
  automatically add .txt when type is Text files.

- bpo-21986: Code objects are not normally pickled by the pickle module. To
  match this, they are no longer pickled when running under Idle.

- bpo-17390: Adjust Editor window title; remove 'Python', move version to
  end.

- bpo-14105: Idle debugger breakpoints no longer disappear when inserting or
  deleting lines.

  bindings for Idle so Caps Lock does not disable them. Patch by Roger
  Serwy.

- bpo-21695: Closing a Find-in-files output window while the search is still
  in progress no longer closes Idle.

- bpo-18910: Add unittest for textView. Patch by Phil Webster.

- bpo-18292: Add unittest for AutoExpand. Patch by Saihadhav Heblikar.

- bpo-18409: Add unittest for AutoComplete. Patch by Phil Webster.

  Saimadhav Heblikar

- bpo-18104: Add idlelib/idle_test/htest.py with a few sample tests to begin
  consolidating and improving human-validated tests of Idle. Change other
  files as needed to work with htest.  Running the module as __main__ runs
  all tests.

- bpo-21139: Change default paragraph width to 72, the PEP 8 recommendation.

- bpo-21284: Paragraph reformat test passes after user changes reformat
  width.

- bpo-17654: Ensure IDLE menus are customized properly on OS X for
  non-framework builds and for all variants of Tk.

  Sweigart.

Build
-----

  configure script.

- bpo-22935: Allow the ssl module to be compiled if openssl doesn't support
  SSL 3.

- bpo-22592: Drop support of the Borland C compiler to build Python. The
  distutils module still supports it to build extensions.

- bpo-22591: Drop support of MS-DOS, especially of the DJGPP compiler
  (MS-DOS port of GCC).

- bpo-16537: Check whether self.extensions is empty in setup.py. Patch by
  Jonathan Hosmer.

- bpo-22359: Remove incorrect uses of recursive make.  Patch by Jonas
  Wagner.

- bpo-21958: Define HAVE_ROUND when building with Visual Studio 2013 and
  above.  Patch by Zachary Turner.

- bpo-18093: the programs that embed the CPython runtime are now in a
  separate "Programs" directory, rather than being kept in the Modules
  directory.

- bpo-15759: "make suspicious", "make linkcheck" and "make doctest" in Doc/
  now display special message when and only when there are failures.

- bpo-21141: The Windows build process no longer attempts to find Perl,
  instead relying on OpenSSL source being configured and ready to build.
  The ``PCbuild\build_ssl.py`` script has been re-written and re-named to
  ``PCbuild\prepare_ssl.py``, and takes care of configuring OpenSSL source
  for both 32 and 64 bit platforms.  OpenSSL sources obtained from
  svn.python.org will always be pre-configured and ready to build.

- bpo-21037: Add a build option to enable AddressSanitizer support.

- bpo-19962: The Windows build process now creates "python.bat" in the root
  of the source tree, which passes all arguments through to the most
  recently built interpreter.

- bpo-21285: Refactor and fix curses configure check to always search in a
  ncursesw directory.

- bpo-15234: For BerkelyDB and Sqlite, only add the found library and
  include directories if they aren't already being searched. This avoids an
  explicit runtime library dependency.

- bpo-17861: Tools/scripts/generate_opcode_h.py automatically regenerates
  Include/opcode.h from Lib/opcode.py if the latter gets any change.

- bpo-20644: OS X installer build support for documentation build changes in
  3.4.1: assume externally supplied sphinx-build is available in /usr/bin.

- bpo-20022: Eliminate use of deprecated bundlebuilder in OS X builds.

- bpo-15968: Incorporated Tcl, Tk, and Tix builds into the Windows build
  solution.

- bpo-17095: Fix Modules/Setup *shared* support.

- bpo-21811: Anticipated fixes to support OS X versions > 10.9.

- bpo-21166: Prevent possible segfaults and other random failures of python
  --generate-posix-vars in pybuilddir.txt build target.

- bpo-18096: Fix library order returned by python-config.

- bpo-17219: Add library build dir for Python extension cross-builds.

- bpo-22919: Windows build updated to support VC 14.0 (Visual Studio 2015),
  which will be used for the official release.

- bpo-21236: Build _msi.pyd with cabinet.lib instead of fci.lib

- bpo-17128: Use private version of OpenSSL for OS X 10.5+ installer.

C API
-----

- bpo-14203: Remove obsolete support for view==NULL in PyBuffer_FillInfo(),
  bytearray_getbuffer(), bytesiobuf_getbuffer() and array_buffer_getbuf().
  All functions now raise BufferError in that case.

- bpo-22445: PyBuffer_IsContiguous() now implements precise contiguity
  tests, compatible with NumPy's NPY_RELAXED_STRIDES_CHECKING compilation
  flag.  Previously the function reported false negatives for corner cases.

- bpo-22079: PyType_Ready() now checks that statically allocated type has no
  dynamically allocated bases.

- bpo-22453: Removed non-documented macro PyObject_REPR().

- bpo-18395: Rename ``_Py_char2wchar()`` to :c:func:`Py_DecodeLocale`,
  rename ``_Py_wchar2char()`` to :c:func:`Py_EncodeLocale`, and document
  these functions.

- bpo-21233: Add new C functions: PyMem_RawCalloc(), PyMem_Calloc(),
  PyObject_Calloc(), _PyObject_GC_Calloc(). bytes(int) is now using
  ``calloc()`` instead of ``malloc()`` for large objects which is faster and
  use less memory.

- bpo-20942: PyImport_ImportFrozenModuleObject() no longer sets __file__ to
  match what importlib does; this affects _frozen_importlib as well as any
  module loaded using imp.init_frozen().

Documentation
-------------

- bpo-19548: Update the codecs module documentation to better cover the
  distinction between text encodings and other codecs, together with other
  clarifications. Patch by Martin Panter.

- bpo-22394: Doc/Makefile now supports ``make venv PYTHON=../python`` to
  create a venv for generating the documentation, e.g., ``make html
  PYTHON=venv/bin/python3``.

- bpo-21514: The documentation of the json module now refers to new JSON RFC
  7159 instead of obsoleted RFC 4627.

  documented explicitly, rather than assuming users will be able to derive
  the expected behaviour from the behaviour of the corresponding str
  methods.

  mention the ability to load the OS certificates.

- bpo-20765: Add missing documentation for PurePath.with_name() and
  PurePath.with_suffix().

- bpo-19407: New package installation and distribution guides based on the
  Python Packaging Authority tools. Existing guides have been retained as
  legacy links from the distutils docs, as they still contain some required
  reference material for tool developers that isn't recorded anywhere else.

- bpo-19697: Document cases where __main__.__spec__ is None.

Tests
-----

- bpo-18982: Add tests for CLI of the calendar module.

- bpo-19548: Added some additional checks to test_codecs to ensure that
  statements in the updated documentation remain accurate. Patch by Martin

  present. Patch by Remi Pointel.

- bpo-20746: Fix test_pdb to run in refleak mode (-R).  Patch by Xavier de
  Gaye.

- bpo-22060: test_ctypes has been somewhat cleaned up and simplified; it now
  uses unittest test discovery to find its tests.

- bpo-22104: regrtest.py no longer holds a reference to the suite of tests
  loaded from test modules that don't define test_main().

- bpo-22111: Assorted cleanups in test_imaplib.  Patch by Milan Oberkirch.

- bpo-22002: Added ``load_package_tests`` function to test.support and used
  it to implement/augment test discovery in test_asyncio, test_email,
  test_importlib, test_json, and test_tools.

- bpo-21976: Fix test_ssl to accept LibreSSL version strings.  Thanks to
  William Orr.

- bpo-21918: Converted test_tools from a module to a package containing
  separate test files for each tested script.

- bpo-9554: Use modern unittest features in test_argparse. Initial patch by
  Denver Coneybeare and Radu Voicilas.

- bpo-20155: Changed HTTP method names in failing tests in test_httpservers
  so that packet filtering software (specifically Windows Base Filtering
  Engine) does not interfere with the transaction semantics expected by the
  tests.

- bpo-19493: Refactored the ctypes test package to skip tests explicitly
  rather than silently.

- bpo-18492: All resources are now allowed when tests are not run by
  regrtest.py.

- bpo-21634: Fix pystone micro-benchmark: use floor division instead of true

  pystone version to 1.2. Patch written by Lennart Regebro.

- bpo-21605: Added tests for Tkinter images.

- bpo-21493: Added test for ntpath.expanduser().  Original patch by Claudiu

- bpo-17756: Fix test_code test when run from the installed location.

- bpo-17752: Fix distutils tests when run from the installed location.

- bpo-18604: Consolidated checks for GUI availability.  All platforms now at
  least check whether Tk can be instantiated when the GUI resource is
  requested.

- bpo-21275: Fix a socket test on KFreeBSD.

- bpo-21223: Pass test_site/test_startup_imports when some of the extensions
  are built as builtins.

- bpo-20635: Added tests for Tk geometry managers.

- Add test case for freeze.

- bpo-20743: Fix a reference leak in test_tcl.

- bpo-20939: Avoid various network test failures due to new redirect of
  http://www.python.org/ to https://www.python.org: use
  http://www.example.com instead.

  Vajrasky Kok)

- bpo-21093: Prevent failures of ctypes test_macholib on OS X if a copy of
  libz exists in $HOME/lib or /usr/local/lib.

- bpo-22770: Prevent some Tk segfaults on OS X when running gui tests.

- bpo-23211: Workaround test_logging failure on some OS X 10.6 systems.

  (like 0.9.8zc).

Tools/Demos
-----------

- bpo-22314: pydoc now works when the LINES environment variable is set.

- bpo-22615: Argument Clinic now supports the "type" argument for the int
  converter. This permits using the int converter with enums and typedefs.

- bpo-20076: The makelocalealias.py script no longer ignores UTF-8 mapping.

- bpo-20079: The makelocalealias.py script now can parse the SUPPORTED file

- bpo-22201: Command-line interface of the zipfile module now correctly
  extracts ZIP files with directory entries.  Patch by Ryan Wilson.

- bpo-22120: For functions using an unsigned integer return converter,
