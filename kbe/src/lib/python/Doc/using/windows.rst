This document aims to give an overview of Windows-specific behaviour you should
know about when using Python on Microsoft Windows.

   This looks rather stale to me...


Installing Python
=================

Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not require Python natively
and thus does not pre-install a version of Python.  However, the CPython team
has compiled Windows installers (MSI packages) with every `release
<http://www.python.org/download/releases/>`_ for many years.

With ongoing development of Python, some platforms that used to be supported
earlier are no longer supported (due to the lack of users or developers).
Check :pep:`11` for details on all unsupported platforms.

* `Windows CE <http://pythonce.sourceforge.net/>`_ is still supported.
* The `Cygwin <http://cygwin.com/>`_ installer offers to install the `Python
  interpreter <http://cygwin.com/packages/python>`_ as well; it is located under
  "Interpreters." (cf. `Cygwin package source
  <ftp://ftp.uni-erlangen.de/pub/pc/gnuwin32/cygwin/mirrors/cygnus/
  release/python>`_, `Maintainer releases
  <http://www.tishler.net/jason/software/python/>`_)

See `Python for Windows <http://www.python.org/download/windows/>`_
for detailed information about platforms with pre-compiled installers.

Alternative bundles
===================

Besides the standard CPython distribution, there are modified packages including
additional functionality.  The following is a list of popular versions and their
key features:

`ActivePython <http://www.activestate.com/activepython/>`_
    Installer with multi-platform compatibility, documentation, PyWin32

`Enthought Python Distribution <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_
    Popular modules (such as PyWin32) with their respective documentation, tool
    suite for building extensible Python applications

Notice that these packages are likely to install *older* versions of Python.



Configuring Python
==================

In order to run Python flawlessly, you might have to change certain environment
settings in Windows.


.. _setting-envvars:

Excursus: Setting environment variables
---------------------------------------

Windows has a built-in dialog for changing environment variables (following
guide applies to XP classical view): Right-click the icon for your machine
(usually located on your Desktop and called "My Computer") and choose
:menuselection:`Properties` there.  Then, open the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab
and click the :guilabel:`Environment Variables` button.

In short, your path is:

    :menuselection:`My Computer
    --> Properties
    --> Advanced
    --> Environment Variables`

In this dialog, you can add or modify User and System variables. To change
System variables, you need non-restricted access to your machine
(i.e. Administrator rights).

Another way of adding variables to your environment is using the :command:`set`
command::

    set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\My_python_lib

To make this setting permanent, you could add the corresponding command line to
your :file:`autoexec.bat`. :program:`msconfig` is a graphical interface to this
file.

Viewing environment variables can also be done more straight-forward: The
command prompt will expand strings wrapped into percent signs automatically::

    echo %PATH%

Consult :command:`set /?` for details on this behaviour.

.. _windows-path-mod:

Finding the Python executable
-----------------------------

.. versionchanged:: 3.3

Besides using the automatically created start menu entry for the Python
interpreter, you might want to start Python in the command prompt. As of
Python 3.3, the installer has an option to set that up for you.

At the "Customize Python 3.3" screen, an option called
"Add python.exe to search path" can be enabled to have the installer place
your installation into the :envvar:`%PATH%`. This allows you to type
:command:`python` to run the interpreter. Thus, you can also execute your
scripts with command line options, see :ref:`using-on-cmdline` documentation.

If you don't enable this option at install time, you can always re-run the
installer to choose it.

The alternative is manually modifying the :envvar:`%PATH%` using the
directions in :ref:`setting-envvars`. You need to set your :envvar:`%PATH%`
environment variable to include the directory of your Python distribution,
delimited by a semicolon from other entries. An example variable could look
like this (assuming the first two entries are Windows' default)::

    C:\WINDOWS\system32;C:\WINDOWS;C:\Python33


Finding modules
---------------

Python usually stores its library (and thereby your site-packages folder) in the
installation directory.  So, if you had installed Python to
:file:`C:\\Python\\`, the default library would reside in
:file:`C:\\Python\\Lib\\` and third-party modules should be stored in
:file:`C:\\Python\\Lib\\site-packages\\`.

This is how :data:`sys.path` is populated on Windows:

* An empty entry is added at the start, which corresponds to the current
  directory.

* If the environment variable :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` exists, as described in
  :ref:`using-on-envvars`, its entries are added next.  Note that on Windows,
  paths in this variable must be separated by semicolons, to distinguish them
  from the colon used in drive identifiers (``C:\`` etc.).

* Additional "application paths" can be added in the registry as subkeys of
  :samp:`\\SOFTWARE\\Python\\PythonCore\\{version}\\PythonPath` under both the
  ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER`` and ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`` hives.  Subkeys which have
  semicolon-delimited path strings as their default value will cause each path
  to be added to :data:`sys.path`.  (Note that all known installers only use
  HKLM, so HKCU is typically empty.)

* If the environment variable :envvar:`PYTHONHOME` is set, it is assumed as
  "Python Home".  Otherwise, the path of the main Python executable is used to
  locate a "landmark file" (``Lib\os.py``) to deduce the "Python Home".  If a
  Python home is found, the relevant sub-directories added to :data:`sys.path`
  (``Lib``, ``plat-win``, etc) are based on that folder.  Otherwise, the core
  Python path is constructed from the PythonPath stored in the registry.

* If the Python Home cannot be located, no :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` is specified in
  the environment, and no registry entries can be found, a default path with
  relative entries is used (e.g. ``.\Lib;.\plat-win``, etc).

The end result of all this is:

* When running :file:`python.exe`, or any other .exe in the main Python
  directory (either an installed version, or directly from the PCbuild
  directory), the core path is deduced, and the core paths in the registry are
  ignored.  Other "application paths" in the registry are always read.

* When Python is hosted in another .exe (different directory, embedded via COM,
  etc), the "Python Home" will not be deduced, so the core path from the
  registry is used.  Other "application paths" in the registry are always read.

* If Python can't find its home and there is no registry (eg, frozen .exe, some
  very strange installation setup) you get a path with some default, but
  relative, paths.


Executing scripts
-----------------

As of Python 3.3, Python includes a launcher which facilitates running Python
scripts. See :ref:`launcher` for more information.

Executing scripts without the Python launcher
---------------------------------------------

Without the Python launcher installed, Python scripts (files with the extension
``.py``) will be executed by :program:`python.exe` by default.  This executable
opens a terminal, which stays open even if the program uses a GUI.  If you do
not want this to happen, use the extension ``.pyw`` which will cause the script
to be executed by :program:`pythonw.exe` by default (both executables are
located in the top-level of your Python installation directory).  This
suppresses the terminal window on startup.

You can also make all ``.py`` scripts execute with :program:`pythonw.exe`,
setting this through the usual facilities, for example (might require
administrative rights):

#. Launch a command prompt.
#. Associate the correct file group with ``.py`` scripts::

      assoc .py=Python.File

#. Redirect all Python files to the new executable::

      ftype Python.File=C:\Path\to\pythonw.exe "%1" %*


.. _launcher:

Python Launcher for Windows
===========================

.. versionadded:: 3.3

The Python launcher for Windows is a utility which aids in the location and
execution of different Python versions.  It allows scripts (or the
command-line) to indicate a preference for a specific Python version, and
will locate and execute that version.

Getting started
---------------

From the command-line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should ensure the launcher is on your PATH - depending on how it was
installed it may already be there, but check just in case it is not.

From a command-prompt, execute the following command:

::

  py

You should find that the latest version of Python 2.x you have installed is
started - it can be exited as normal, and any additional command-line
arguments specified will be sent directly to Python.

If you have multiple versions of Python 2.x installed (e.g., 2.6 and 2.7) you
will have noticed that Python 2.7 was started - to launch Python 2.6, try the
command:

::

  py -2.6

If you have a Python 3.x installed, try the command:

::

  py -3

You should find the latest version of Python 3.x starts.

From a script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's create a test Python script - create a file called ``hello.py`` with the
following contents

::

    #! python
    import sys
    sys.stdout.write("hello from Python %s\n" % (sys.version,))

From the directory in which hello.py lives, execute the command:

::

   py hello.py

You should notice the version number of your latest Python 2.x installation
is printed.  Now try changing the first line to be:

::

    #! python3

Re-executing the command should now print the latest Python 3.x information.
As with the above command-line examples, you can specify a more explicit
version qualifier.  Assuming you have Python 2.6 installed, try changing the
first line to ``#! python2.6`` and you should find the 2.6 version
information printed.

From file associations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The launcher should have been associated with Python files (i.e. ``.py``,
``.pyw``, ``.pyc``, ``.pyo`` files) when it was installed.  This means that
when you double-click on one of these files from Windows explorer the launcher
will be used, and therefore you can use the same facilities described above to
have the script specify the version which should be used.

The key benefit of this is that a single launcher can support multiple Python
versions at the same time depending on the contents of the first line.

Shebang Lines
-------------

If the first line of a script file starts with ``#!``, it is known as a
"shebang" line.  Linux and other Unix like operating systems have native
support for such lines and are commonly used on such systems to indicate how
a script should be executed.  This launcher allows the same facilities to be
using with Python scripts on Windows and the examples above demonstrate their
use.

To allow shebang lines in Python scripts to be portable between Unix and
Windows, this launcher supports a number of 'virtual' commands to specify
which interpreter to use.  The supported virtual commands are:

* ``/usr/bin/env python``
* ``/usr/bin/python``
* ``/usr/local/bin/python``
* ``python``

For example, if the first line of your script starts with

::

  #! /usr/bin/python

The default Python will be located and used.  As many Python scripts written
to work on Unix will already have this line, you should find these scripts can
be used by the launcher without modification.  If you are writing a new script
on Windows which you hope will be useful on Unix, you should use one of the
shebang lines starting with ``/usr``.

Arguments in shebang lines
--------------------------

The shebang lines can also specify additional options to be passed to the
Python interpreter.  For example, if you have a shebang line:

::

  #! /usr/bin/python -v

Then Python will be started with the ``-v`` option

Customization
-------------

Customization via INI files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    Two .ini files will be searched by the launcher - ``py.ini`` in the
    current user's "application data" directory (i.e. the directory returned
    by calling the Windows function SHGetFolderPath with CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA)
    and ``py.ini`` in the same directory as the launcher.  The same .ini
    files are used for both the 'console' version of the launcher (i.e.
    py.exe) and for the 'windows' version (i.e. pyw.exe)

    Customization specified in the "application directory" will have
    precedence over the one next to the executable, so a user, who may not
    have write access to the .ini file next to the launcher, can override
    commands in that global .ini file)

Customizing default Python versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, a version qualifier can be included in a command to dictate
which version of Python will be used by the command. A version qualifier
starts with a major version number and can optionally be followed by a period
('.') and a minor version specifier. If the minor qualifier is specified, it
may optionally be followed by "-32" to indicate the 32-bit implementation of
that version be used.

For example, a shebang line of ``#!python`` has no version qualifier, while
``#!python3`` has a version qualifier which specifies only a major version.

If no version qualifiers are found in a command, the environment variable
``PY_PYTHON`` can be set to specify the default version qualifier - the default
value is "2". Note this value could specify just a major version (e.g. "2") or
a major.minor qualifier (e.g. "2.6"), or even major.minor-32.

If no minor version qualifiers are found, the environment variable
``PY_PYTHON{major}`` (where ``{major}`` is the current major version qualifier
as determined above) can be set to specify the full version. If no such option
is found, the launcher will enumerate the installed Python versions and use
the latest minor release found for the major version, which is likely,
although not guaranteed, to be the most recently installed version in that
family.

On 64-bit Windows with both 32-bit and 64-bit implementations of the same
(major.minor) Python version installed, the 64-bit version will always be
preferred. This will be true for both 32-bit and 64-bit implementations of the
launcher - a 32-bit launcher will prefer to execute a 64-bit Python installation
of the specified version if available. This is so the behavior of the launcher
can be predicted knowing only what versions are installed on the PC and
without regard to the order in which they were installed (i.e., without knowing
whether a 32 or 64-bit version of Python and corresponding launcher was
installed last). As noted above, an optional "-32" suffix can be used on a
version specifier to change this behaviour.

Examples:

* If no relevant options are set, the commands ``python`` and
  ``python2`` will use the latest Python 2.x version installed and
  the command ``python3`` will use the latest Python 3.x installed.

* The commands ``python3.1`` and ``python2.7`` will not consult any
  options at all as the versions are fully specified.

* If ``PY_PYTHON=3``, the commands ``python`` and ``python3`` will both use
  the latest installed Python 3 version.

* If ``PY_PYTHON=3.1-32``, the command ``python`` will use the 32-bit
  implementation of 3.1 whereas the command ``python3`` will use the latest
  installed Python (PY_PYTHON was not considered at all as a major
  version was specified.)

* If ``PY_PYTHON=3`` and ``PY_PYTHON3=3.1``, the commands
  ``python`` and ``python3`` will both use specifically 3.1

In addition to environment variables, the same settings can be configured
in the .INI file used by the launcher.  The section in the INI file is
called ``[defaults]`` and the key name will be the same as the
environment variables without the leading ``PY_`` prefix (and note that
the key names in the INI file are case insensitive.)  The contents of
an environment variable will override things specified in the INI file.

For example:

* Setting ``PY_PYTHON=3.1`` is equivalent to the INI file containing:

::

  [defaults]
  python=3.1

* Setting ``PY_PYTHON=3`` and ``PY_PYTHON3=3.1`` is equivalent to the INI file
  containing:

::

  [defaults]
  python=3
  python3=3.1

Diagnostics
-----------

If an environment variable ``PYLAUNCH_DEBUG`` is set (to any value), the
launcher will print diagnostic information to stderr (i.e. to the console).
While this information manages to be simultaneously verbose *and* terse, it
should allow you to see what versions of Python were located, why a
particular version was chosen and the exact command-line used to execute the
target Python.


Additional modules
==================

Even though Python aims to be portable among all platforms, there are features
that are unique to Windows.  A couple of modules, both in the standard library
and external, and snippets exist to use these features.

The Windows-specific standard modules are documented in
:ref:`mswin-specific-services`.


PyWin32
-------

The `PyWin32 <http://python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/>`_ module by Mark Hammond
is a collection of modules for advanced Windows-specific support.  This includes
utilities for:

* `Component Object Model <http://www.microsoft.com/com/>`_ (COM)
* Win32 API calls
* Registry
* Event log
* `Microsoft Foundation Classes <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fe1cf721%28VS.80%29.aspx>`_ (MFC)
  user interfaces

`PythonWin <http://web.archive.org/web/20060524042422/
http://www.python.org/windows/pythonwin/>`_ is a sample MFC application
shipped with PyWin32.  It is an embeddable IDE with a built-in debugger.

      by David and Paul Boddie


cx_Freeze
---------

`cx_Freeze <http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/>`_ is a :mod:`distutils`
extension (see :ref:`extending-distutils`) which wraps Python scripts into
executable Windows programs (:file:`{*}.exe` files).  When you have done this,
you can distribute your application without requiring your users to install
Python.


WConio
------

Since Python's advanced terminal handling layer, :mod:`curses`, is restricted to
Unix-like systems, there is a library exclusive to Windows as well: Windows
Console I/O for Python.

`WConio <http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/wconio.html>`_ is a wrapper for
Turbo-C's :file:`CONIO.H`, used to create text user interfaces.



Compiling Python on Windows
===========================

If you want to compile CPython yourself, first thing you should do is get the
`source <http://python.org/download/source/>`_. You can download either the
latest release's source or just grab a fresh `checkout
<http://docs.python.org/devguide/setup#checking-out-the-code>`_.

The source tree contains a build solution and project files for Microsoft
Visual C++, which is the compiler used to build the official Python releases.
View the :file:`readme.txt` in their respective directories:

+--------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
| Directory          | MSVC version | Visual Studio version |
+====================+==============+=======================+
| :file:`PC/VS9.0/`  | 9.0          | 2008                  |
+--------------------+--------------+-----------------------+
| :file:`PCbuild/`   | 10.0         | 2010                  |
+--------------------+--------------+-----------------------+

Note that any build directories within the :file:`PC` directory are not
necessarily fully supported.  The :file:`PCbuild` directory contains the files
for the compiler used to build the official release.

Check :file:`PCbuild/readme.txt` for general information on the build process.


For extension modules, consult :ref:`building-on-windows`.
