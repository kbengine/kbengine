:mod:`time` --- Time access and conversions
===========================================

.. module:: time
   :synopsis: Time access and conversions.


This module provides various time-related functions. For related
functionality, see also the :mod:`datetime` and :mod:`calendar` modules.

Although this module is always available,
not all functions are available on all platforms.  Most of the functions
defined in this module call platform C library functions with the same name.  It
may sometimes be helpful to consult the platform documentation, because the
semantics of these functions varies among platforms.

An explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order.

.. index:: single: epoch

* The :dfn:`epoch` is the point where the time starts.  On January 1st of that
  year, at 0 hours, the "time since the epoch" is zero.  For Unix, the epoch is
  1970.  To find out what the epoch is, look at ``gmtime(0)``.

.. index:: single: Year 2038

* The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before the epoch or
  far in the future.  The cut-off point in the future is determined by the C
  library; for 32-bit systems, it is typically in 2038.

.. index::
   single: Year 2000
   single: Y2K

.. _time-y2kissues:

* **Year 2000 (Y2K) issues**: Python depends on the platform's C library, which
  generally doesn't have year 2000 issues, since all dates and times are
  represented internally as seconds since the epoch.  Function :func:`strptime`
  can parse 2-digit years when given ``%y`` format code.  When 2-digit years are
  parsed, they are converted according to the POSIX and ISO C standards: values
  69--99 are mapped to 1969--1999, and values 0--68 are mapped to 2000--2068.

.. index::
   single: UTC
   single: Coordinated Universal Time
   single: Greenwich Mean Time

* UTC is Coordinated Universal Time (formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time, or
  GMT).  The acronym UTC is not a mistake but a compromise between English and
  French.

.. index:: single: Daylight Saving Time

* DST is Daylight Saving Time, an adjustment of the timezone by (usually) one
  hour during part of the year.  DST rules are magic (determined by local law) and
  can change from year to year.  The C library has a table containing the local
  rules (often it is read from a system file for flexibility) and is the only
  source of True Wisdom in this respect.

* The precision of the various real-time functions may be less than suggested by
  the units in which their value or argument is expressed. E.g. on most Unix
  systems, the clock "ticks" only 50 or 100 times a second.

* On the other hand, the precision of :func:`.time` and :func:`sleep` is better
  than their Unix equivalents: times are expressed as floating point numbers,
  :func:`.time` returns the most accurate time available (using Unix
  :c:func:`gettimeofday` where available), and :func:`sleep` will accept a time
  with a nonzero fraction (Unix :c:func:`select` is used to implement this, where
  available).

* The time value as returned by :func:`gmtime`, :func:`localtime`, and
  :func:`strptime`, and accepted by :func:`asctime`, :func:`mktime` and
  :func:`strftime`, is a sequence of 9 integers.  The return values of
  :func:`gmtime`, :func:`localtime`, and :func:`strptime` also offer attribute
  names for individual fields.

  See :class:`struct_time` for a description of these objects.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.3
     The :class:`struct_time` type was extended to provide the :attr:`tm_gmtoff`
     and :attr:`tm_zone` attributes when platform supports corresponding
     ``struct tm`` members.

* Use the following functions to convert between time representations:

  +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+


The module defines the following functions and data items:

.. data:: altzone

   The offset of the local DST timezone, in seconds west of UTC, if one is defined.
   This is negative if the local DST timezone is east of UTC (as in Western Europe,
   including the UK).  Only use this if ``daylight`` is nonzero.


.. function:: asctime([t])

   Convert a tuple or :class:`struct_time` representing a time as returned by
   :func:`gmtime` or :func:`localtime` to a string of the following
   form: ``'Sun Jun 20 23:21:05 1993'``.  If *t* is not provided, the current time
   as returned by :func:`localtime` is used. Locale information is not used by
   :func:`asctime`.

   .. note::

      Unlike the C function of the same name, :func:`asctime` does not add a
      trailing newline.


.. function:: clock()

   .. index::
      single: CPU time
      single: processor time
      single: benchmarking

   On Unix, return the current processor time as a floating point number expressed
   in seconds.  The precision, and in fact the very definition of the meaning of
   "processor time", depends on that of the C function of the same name, but in any
   case, this is the function to use for benchmarking Python or timing algorithms.

   On Windows, this function returns wall-clock seconds elapsed since the first
   call to this function, as a floating point number, based on the Win32 function
   :c:func:`QueryPerformanceCounter`. The resolution is typically better than one
   microsecond.

   .. deprecated:: 3.3
      The behaviour of this function depends on the platform: use
      :func:`perf_counter` or :func:`process_time` instead, depending on your
      requirements, to have a well defined behaviour.


.. function:: clock_getres(clk_id)

   Return the resolution (precision) of the specified clock *clk_id*.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. function:: clock_gettime(clk_id)

   Return the time of the specified clock *clk_id*.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. function:: clock_settime(clk_id, time)

   Set the time of the specified clock *clk_id*.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. data:: CLOCK_HIGHRES

   The Solaris OS has a CLOCK_HIGHRES timer that attempts to use an optimal
   hardware source, and may give close to nanosecond resolution.  CLOCK_HIGHRES
   is the nonadjustable, high-resolution clock.

   Availability: Solaris.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. data:: CLOCK_MONOTONIC

   Clock that cannot be set and represents monotonic time since some unspecified
   starting point.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. data:: CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW

   Similar to :data:`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, but provides access to a raw
   hardware-based time that is not subject to NTP adjustments.

   Availability: Linux 2.6.28 or later.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. data:: CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID

   High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. data:: CLOCK_REALTIME

   System-wide real-time clock.  Setting this clock requires appropriate
   privileges.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. data:: CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID

   Thread-specific CPU-time clock.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. function:: ctime([secs])

   Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string representing
   local time. If *secs* is not provided or :const:`None`, the current time as
   returned by :func:`.time` is used.  ``ctime(secs)`` is equivalent to
   ``asctime(localtime(secs))``. Locale information is not used by :func:`ctime`.


.. data:: daylight

   Nonzero if a DST timezone is defined.


.. function:: get_clock_info(name)

   Get information on the specified clock as a namespace object.
   Supported clock names and the corresponding functions to read their value
   are:

   * ``'clock'``: :func:`time.clock`
   * ``'monotonic'``: :func:`time.monotonic`
   * ``'perf_counter'``: :func:`time.perf_counter`
   * ``'process_time'``: :func:`time.process_time`
   * ``'time'``: :func:`time.time`

   The result has the following attributes:

   - *adjustable*: ``True`` if the clock can be changed automatically (e.g. by
     a NTP daemon) or manually by the system administrator, ``False`` otherwise
   - *implementation*: The name of the underlying C function used to get
     the clock value
   - *monotonic*: ``True`` if the clock cannot go backward,
     ``False`` otherwise
   - *resolution*: The resolution of the clock in seconds (:class:`float`)

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. function:: gmtime([secs])

   Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a :class:`struct_time` in
   UTC in which the dst flag is always zero.  If *secs* is not provided or
   :const:`None`, the current time as returned by :func:`.time` is used.  Fractions
   of a second are ignored.  See above for a description of the
   :class:`struct_time` object. See :func:`calendar.timegm` for the inverse of this
   function.


.. function:: localtime([secs])

   Like :func:`gmtime` but converts to local time.  If *secs* is not provided or
   :const:`None`, the current time as returned by :func:`.time` is used.  The dst
   flag is set to ``1`` when DST applies to the given time.


.. function:: mktime(t)

   This is the inverse function of :func:`localtime`.  Its argument is the
   :class:`struct_time` or full 9-tuple (since the dst flag is needed; use ``-1``
   as the dst flag if it is unknown) which expresses the time in *local* time, not
   UTC.  It returns a floating point number, for compatibility with :func:`.time`.
   If the input value cannot be represented as a valid time, either
   :exc:`OverflowError` or :exc:`ValueError` will be raised (which depends on
   whether the invalid value is caught by Python or the underlying C libraries).
   The earliest date for which it can generate a time is platform-dependent.


.. function:: monotonic()

   Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock
   that cannot go backwards.  The clock is not affected by system clock updates.
   The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the
   difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.

   On Windows versions older than Vista, :func:`monotonic` detects
   :c:func:`GetTickCount` integer overflow (32 bits, roll-over after 49.7 days).
   It increases an internal epoch (reference time) by 2\ :sup:`32` each time
   that an overflow is detected.  The epoch is stored in the process-local state
   and so the value of :func:`monotonic` may be different in two Python
   processes running for more than 49 days. On more recent versions of Windows
   and on other operating systems, :func:`monotonic` is system-wide.

   Availability: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. function:: perf_counter()

   Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a
   clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration.  It
   does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide.  The reference
   point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between
   the results of consecutive calls is valid.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3


.. function:: process_time()

   Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user
   CPU time of the current process.  It does not include time elapsed during
   sleep.  It is process-wide by definition.  The reference point of the
   returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results
   of consecutive calls is valid.

   .. versionadded:: 3.3

.. function:: sleep(secs)

   Suspend execution for the given number of seconds.  The argument may be a
   floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep time. The actual
   suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will
   terminate the :func:`sleep` following execution of that signal's catching
   routine.  Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary
   amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system.


.. function:: strftime(format[, t])

   Convert a tuple or :class:`struct_time` representing a time as returned by
   :func:`gmtime` or :func:`localtime` to a string as specified by the *format*
   argument.  If *t* is not provided, the current time as returned by
   :func:`localtime` is used.  *format* must be a string.  :exc:`ValueError` is
   raised if any field in *t* is outside of the allowed range.

   0 is a legal argument for any position in the time tuple; if it is normally
   illegal the value is forced to a correct one.

   The following directives can be embedded in the *format* string. They are shown
   without the optional field width and precision specification, and are replaced
   by the indicated characters in the :func:`strftime` result:

   +-----------+------------------------------------------------+-------+

   Notes:

   (1)
      When used with the :func:`strptime` function, the ``%p`` directive only affects
      the output hour field if the ``%I`` directive is used to parse the hour.

   (2)
      The range really is ``0`` to ``61``; value ``60`` is valid in
      timestamps representing leap seconds and value ``61`` is supported
      for historical reasons.

   (3)
      When used with the :func:`strptime` function, ``%U`` and ``%W`` are only used in
      calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified.

   Here is an example, a format for dates compatible with that specified  in the
   :rfc:`2822` Internet email standard.  [#]_ ::

      >>> from time import gmtime, strftime
      >>> strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", gmtime())
      'Thu, 28 Jun 2001 14:17:15 +0000'

   Additional directives may be supported on certain platforms, but only the
   ones listed here have a meaning standardized by ANSI C.  To see the full set
   of format codes supported on your platform, consult the :manpage:`strftime(3)`
   documentation.

   On some platforms, an optional field width and precision specification can
   immediately follow the initial ``'%'`` of a directive in the following order;
   this is also not portable. The field width is normally 2 except for ``%j`` where
   it is 3.


.. function:: strptime(string[, format])

   Parse a string representing a time according to a format.  The return value
   is a :class:`struct_time` as returned by :func:`gmtime` or
   :func:`localtime`.

   The *format* parameter uses the same directives as those used by
   :func:`strftime`; it defaults to ``"%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y"`` which matches the
   formatting returned by :func:`ctime`. If *string* cannot be parsed according
   to *format*, or if it has excess data after parsing, :exc:`ValueError` is
   raised. The default values used to fill in any missing data when more
   accurate values cannot be inferred are ``(1900, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1)``.
   Both *string* and *format* must be strings.

   For example:

      >>> import time
      >>> time.strptime("30 Nov 00", "%d %b %y")   # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
      time.struct_time(tm_year=2000, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0,
                       tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=335, tm_isdst=-1)

   Support for the ``%Z`` directive is based on the values contained in ``tzname``
   and whether ``daylight`` is true.  Because of this, it is platform-specific
   except for recognizing UTC and GMT which are always known (and are considered to
   be non-daylight savings timezones).

   Only the directives specified in the documentation are supported.  Because
   ``strftime()`` is implemented per platform it can sometimes offer more
   directives than those listed.  But ``strptime()`` is independent of any platform
   and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not
   documented as supported.


.. class:: struct_time

   The type of the time value sequence returned by :func:`gmtime`,
   :func:`localtime`, and :func:`strptime`.  It is an object with a :term:`named
   tuple` interface: values can be accessed by index and by attribute name.  The
   following values are present:

   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | Index | Attribute         | Values                          |
   +=======+===================+=================================+
   | 0     | :attr:`tm_year`   | (for example, 1993)             |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 1     | :attr:`tm_mon`    | range [1, 12]                   |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 2     | :attr:`tm_mday`   | range [1, 31]                   |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 3     | :attr:`tm_hour`   | range [0, 23]                   |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 4     | :attr:`tm_min`    | range [0, 59]                   |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 5     | :attr:`tm_sec`    | range [0, 61]; see **(2)** in   |
   |       |                   | :func:`strftime` description    |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 6     | :attr:`tm_wday`   | range [0, 6], Monday is 0       |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 7     | :attr:`tm_yday`   | range [1, 366]                  |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | 8     | :attr:`tm_isdst`  | 0, 1 or -1; see below           |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | N/A   | :attr:`tm_zone`   | abbreviation of timezone name   |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+
   | N/A   | :attr:`tm_gmtoff` | offset east of UTC in seconds   |
   +-------+-------------------+---------------------------------+

   Note that unlike the C structure, the month value is a range of [1, 12], not
   [0, 11].  A ``-1`` argument as the daylight
   savings flag, passed to :func:`mktime` will usually result in the correct
   daylight savings state to be filled in.

   When a tuple with an incorrect length is passed to a function expecting a
   :class:`struct_time`, or having elements of the wrong type, a
   :exc:`TypeError` is raised.

  .. versionchanged:: 3.3
     :attr:`tm_gmtoff` and :attr:`tm_zone` attributes are available on platforms
     with C library supporting the corresponding fields in ``struct tm``.

.. function:: time()

   Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number.
   Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating point
   number, not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second.
   While this function normally returns non-decreasing values, it can return a
   lower value than a previous call if the system clock has been set back between
   the two calls.

.. data:: timezone

   The offset of the local (non-DST) timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative in
   most of Western Europe, positive in the US, zero in the UK).


.. data:: tzname

   A tuple of two strings: the first is the name of the local non-DST timezone, the
   second is the name of the local DST timezone.  If no DST timezone is defined,
   the second string should not be used.


.. function:: tzset()

   Resets the time conversion rules used by the library routines. The environment
   variable :envvar:`TZ` specifies how this is done.

   Availability: Unix.

   .. note::

      Although in many cases, changing the :envvar:`TZ` environment variable may
      affect the output of functions like :func:`localtime` without calling
      :func:`tzset`, this behavior should not be relied on.

      The :envvar:`TZ` environment variable should contain no whitespace.

   The standard format of the :envvar:`TZ` environment variable is (whitespace
   added for clarity)::

      std offset [dst [offset [,start[/time], end[/time]]]]

   Where the components are:

   ``std`` and ``dst``
      Three or more alphanumerics giving the timezone abbreviations. These will be
      propagated into time.tzname

   ``offset``
      The offset has the form: ``± hh[:mm[:ss]]``. This indicates the value
      added the local time to arrive at UTC.  If preceded by a '-', the timezone
      is east of the Prime Meridian; otherwise, it is west. If no offset follows
      dst, summer time is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.

   ``start[/time], end[/time]``
      Indicates when to change to and back from DST. The format of the
      start and end dates are one of the following:

      :samp:`J{n}`
         The Julian day *n* (1 <= *n* <= 365). Leap days are not counted, so in
         all years February 28 is day 59 and March 1 is day 60.

      :samp:`{n}`
         The zero-based Julian day (0 <= *n* <= 365). Leap days are counted, and
         it is possible to refer to February 29.

      :samp:`M{m}.{n}.{d}`
         The *d*'th day (0 <= *d* <= 6) or week *n* of month *m* of the year (1
         <= *n* <= 5, 1 <= *m* <= 12, where week 5 means "the last *d* day in
         month *m*" which may occur in either the fourth or the fifth
         week). Week 1 is the first week in which the *d*'th day occurs. Day
         zero is Sunday.

      ``time`` has the same format as ``offset`` except that no leading sign
      ('-' or '+') is allowed. The default, if time is not given, is 02:00:00.

   ::

      >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'EST+05EDT,M4.1.0,M10.5.0'
      >>> time.tzset()
      >>> time.strftime('%X %x %Z')
      '02:07:36 05/08/03 EDT'
      >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'AEST-10AEDT-11,M10.5.0,M3.5.0'
      >>> time.tzset()
      >>> time.strftime('%X %x %Z')
      '16:08:12 05/08/03 AEST'

   On many Unix systems (including \*BSD, Linux, Solaris, and Darwin), it is more
   convenient to use the system's zoneinfo (:manpage:`tzfile(5)`)  database to
   specify the timezone rules. To do this, set the  :envvar:`TZ` environment
   variable to the path of the required timezone  datafile, relative to the root of
   the systems 'zoneinfo' timezone database, usually located at
   :file:`/usr/share/zoneinfo`. For example,  ``'US/Eastern'``,
   ``'Australia/Melbourne'``, ``'Egypt'`` or  ``'Europe/Amsterdam'``. ::

      >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'US/Eastern'
      >>> time.tzset()
      >>> time.tzname
      ('EST', 'EDT')
      >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'Egypt'
      >>> time.tzset()
      >>> time.tzname
      ('EET', 'EEST')

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] The use of ``%Z`` is now deprecated, but the ``%z`` escape that expands to the
   preferred  hour/minute offset is not supported by all ANSI C libraries. Also, a
   strict reading of the original 1982 :rfc:`822` standard calls for a two-digit
   year (%y rather than %Y), but practice moved to 4-digit years long before the
   year 2000.  After that, :rfc:`822` became obsolete and the 4-digit year has
   been first recommended by :rfc:`1123` and then mandated by :rfc:`2822`.
