.SH "SUPPORTED PLATFORMS"


Libbson is continuously tested on GNU/Linux, Windows 7, Mac OS X 10.10, and Solaris 11 (Intel and Sparc). GCC, Clang, and Visual Studio 2013 compilers are continuously tested.

The library supports the following operating systems and CPU architectures:

.SH "INSTALLING FROM SOURCE"


The following instructions are for UNIX\(hylike systems such as GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. To build on Windows, see the instructions for
.B Building on Windows
\e&.

The most recent release of libbson is 1.3.5 and can be
.B downloaded here
\e&. The following snippet will download and extract the current release of the driver.

Minimal dependencies are needed to build Libbson. On UNIX\(hylike systems, pthreads (the POSIX threading library) is required.

Make sure you have access to a
.B supported toolchain
such as GCC, Clang, SolarisStudio, or MinGW. Optionally,
.B pkg\(hyconfig
can be used if your system supports it to simplify locating proper compiler and linker arguments when compiling your program.

The following will configure for a typical 64\(hybit Linux system such as RedHat Enterprise Linux 6 or CentOS 6. Note that not all systems place 64\(hybit libraries in
.B /usr/lib64
\e&. Check your system to see what the convention is if you are building 64\(hybit versions of the library.

.B $ 

If
.B configure
completed successfully, you'll see something like the following describing your build configuration.

.nf
libbson was configured with the following options:

Build configuration:
  Enable debugging (slow)                          : no
  Compile with debug symbols (slow)                : no
  Enable GCC build optimization                    : yes
  Enable automatic binary hardening                : yes
  Code coverage support                            : no
  Cross Compiling                                  : no
  Libbson                                          : bundled

Documentation:
  man                                              : yes
  HTML                                             : yes
  Yelp                                             : no

We can now build libbson with the venerable
.B make
program.

.B $ 

.B NOTE
.RS
You can optionally build code objects in parallel using the
.B \(hyj
option to GNU make. Some implementations of
.B make
do not support this option, such as Sun's make on Solaris 10. To build in parallel on an 8 core machine, you might use:

.B $ 

.RE

To install the driver, we use
.B make
with the
.B install
target.

.B $ 

.B NOTE
.RS
On systems that do not support the
.B sudo
command, we can use
.B su \(hyc 'make install'
\e&.

.SH "BUILDING ON WINDOWS"

Building on Windows requires Windows Vista or newer and Visual Studio 2010 or newer. Additionally,
.B cmake
is required to generate Visual Studio project files.

Let's start by generating Visual Studio project files for libbson. The following assumes we are compiling for 64\(hybit Windows using Visual Studio 2010 Express which can be freely downloaded from Microsoft.
