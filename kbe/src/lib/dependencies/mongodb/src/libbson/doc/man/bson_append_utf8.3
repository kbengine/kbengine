.TP
.B
key
An ASCII C string containing the name of the field.
.LP
.TP
.B
key_length
The length of
.B key
in bytes, or \(hy1 to determine the length with
.B strlen(3)
\e&.
.LP
.TP
.B
value
A UTF\(hy8 encoded string.
.LP
.TP
.B
length
The number of bytes in
.B value
excluding the trailing
.B \e0
, or \(hy1 to determine the length with
.B strlen(3)
\e&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

The
.B bson_append_utf8(3)
function shall append a UTF\(hy8 encoded string to
.B bson
\e&.

_value_
.B MUST
be valid UTF\(hy8.

Some UTF\(hy8 implementations allow for
.B \e0
to be contained within the string (excluding the termination
.B \e0
\e&. This is allowed, but remember that it could cause issues with communicating with external systems that do not support it.

It is suggested to use modified UTF\(hy8 which uses a 2 byte representation for embedded
.B \e0
within the string. This will allow these UTF\(hy8 encoded strings to used with many libc functions.

.SH "RETURNS"

true if the operation was applied successfully, otherwise false and
.B bson
should be discarded.
