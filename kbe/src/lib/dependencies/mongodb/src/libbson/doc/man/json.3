.SH "CONVERTING BSON TO JSON"


There are often times where you might want to convert a BSON document to JSON. It is convenient for debugging as well as an interchange format. To help with this, Libbson contains the function
.B bson_as_json(3)
\e&.


.SH "CONVERTING JSON TO BSON"


Converting back from JSON is also useful and common enough that we added
.B bson_init_from_json(3)
and
.B bson_new_from_json(3)
\e&.

The following example creates a new
.B bson_t
from the JSON string
.B {"a":1}
\e&.


.SH "STREAMING JSON PARSING"


Libbson provides
.B bson_json_reader_t
to allow for parsing a sequence of JSON documents into BSON. The interface is similar to
.B bson_reader_t
but expects the input to be in the
.B MongoDB extended JSON
format.


.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following example reads BSON documents from
.B stdin
and prints them to
.B stdout
as JSON.
