.SH "RECURSING INTO SUB\(hyDOCUMENTS"

Libbson provides convenient sub\(hyiterators to dive down into a sub\(hydocument or sub\(hyarray. Below is an example that will dive into a sub\(hydocument named "foo" and print it's field names.


.SH "FINDING FIELDS USING DOT NOTATION"

Using the
.B bson_iter_recurse(3)
function exemplified above,
.B bson_iter_find_descendant(3)
can find a field for you using the MongoDB style path notation such as "foo.bar.0.baz".

Let's create a document like
.B {"foo": {"bar": [{"baz: 1}]}}
and locate the
.B "baz"
field.


.SH "VALIDATING A BSON DOCUMENT"

If all you want to do is validate that a BSON document is valid, you can use
.B bson_validate(3)
\e&.


See the
.B bson_validate(3)
documentation for more information and examples.
