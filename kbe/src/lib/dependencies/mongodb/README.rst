How To Ask For Help
-------------------

If you are having difficulty building the driver after reading the below instructions, please email
the `mongodb-user list`_ to ask for help. Please include in your email all of the following
information:

- The version of the driver you are trying to build (branch or tag).
    - Examples: master branch, 1.2.1 tag
- Host OS, version, and architecture.
    - Examples: Windows 8 64-bit x86, Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit x86, OS X Mavericks
- C Compiler and version.
    - Examples: GCC 4.8.2, MSVC 2013 Express, clang 3.4, XCode 5
- The output of ``./autogen.sh`` or ``./configure`` (depending on whether you are building from a
  repository checkout or from a tarball). The output starting from "libbson was configured with
  the following options" is sufficient.
- The text of the error you encountered.

Failure to include the relevant information will result in additional round-trip
communications to ascertain the necessary details, delaying a useful response.
Here is a made-up example of a help request that provides the relevant
information:

  Hello, I'm trying to build the C driver with SSL, from mongo-c-driver-1.2.1.tar.gz. I'm on Ubuntu
  14.04, 64-bit Intel, with gcc 4.8.2. I run configure like::

    $ ./configure --enable-sasl=yes
    checking for gcc... gcc
    checking whether the C compiler works... yes

    ... SNIPPED OUTPUT, but when you ask for help, include full output without any omissions ...

    checking for pkg-config... no
    checking for SASL... no
    checking for sasl_client_init in -lsasl2... no
    checking for sasl_client_init in -lsasl... no
    configure: error: You must install the Cyrus SASL libraries and development headers to enable SASL support.

  Can you tell me what I need to install? Thanks!

Security Vulnerabilities
------------------------

If you’ve identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other
MongoDB project, please report it according to the `instructions here
<http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report>`_.


Building the Driver from Source
===============================

Detailed installation instructions are in the manual:
http://api.mongodb.org/c/current/installing.html

From a tarball
--------------

  $ tar xzf mongo-c-driver-$ver.tar.gz
  $ cd mongo-c-driver-$ver
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

To see all of the options available to you during configuration, run::

  $ ./configure --help

To build on Windows Vista or newer with Visual Studio 2010, do the following::

  cd mongo-c-driver-$ver
  cd src\libbson
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\usr -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" .
  msbuild.exe ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
  msbuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj
  cd ..\..
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\usr -DBSON_ROOT_DIR=C:\usr -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" .
  msbuild.exe ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
  msbuild.exe INSTALL.vcxproj

Building From Git
