.SH NAME
mongoc_stream_t \- typedef struct _mongoc_stream_t mongoc_stream_t
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.nf
typedef struct _mongoc_stream_t mongoc_stream_t

.B mongoc_stream_t
provides a generic streaming IO abstraction based on a struct of pointers interface. The idea is to allow wrappers, perhaps other language drivers, to easily shim their IO system on top of
.B mongoc_stream_t
\e&.

The API for the stream abstraction is currently private and non\(hyextensible.

.SH "STREAM TYPES"

There are a number of built in stream types that come with mongoc. The default configuration is a buffered unix stream.  If SSL is in use, that in turn is wrapped in a tls stream.
