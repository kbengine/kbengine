.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function is a wrapper around the BSD socket
.B connect(3)
interface. It provides better portability between UNIX\(hylike and Microsoft Windows platforms.

This function performs a socket connection but will fail if @expire_at has been reached by the monotonic clock. Keep in mind that this is an absolute timeout in milliseconds. You should add your desired timeout to
.B bson_get_monotonic_time(3)
\e&.

.SH "RETURNS"

0 if successful, \(hy1 on failure and errno is set.
