.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This structure is used to set the SSL options for a
.B mongoc_client_t
or
.B mongoc_client_pool_t
\e&.

Beginning in version 1.2.0, once a pool or client has any SSL options set, all connections use SSL, even if "ssl=true" is omitted from the MongoDB URI. Before, SSL options were ignored unless "ssl=true" was included in the URI.
