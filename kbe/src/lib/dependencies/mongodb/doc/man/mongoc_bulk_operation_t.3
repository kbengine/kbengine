The opaque type
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_t
provides an abstraction for submitting multiple write operations as a single batch.

After adding all of the write operations to the
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_t
, call
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_execute(3)
to execute the operation.

.B NOTE

It is only valid to call
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_execute(3)
once. The
.B mongoc_bulk_operation_t
must be destroyed afterwards.
