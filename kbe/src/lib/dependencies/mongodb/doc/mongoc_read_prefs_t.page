    <title>Synopsis</title>
    <p><code xref="mongoc_read_prefs_t">mongoc_read_prefs_t</code> provides an abstraction on top of the MongoDB connection read prefences. It allows for hinting to the driver which nodes in a replica set should be accessed first.</p>
    <p>You can specify a read preference mode on connection objects, database objects, collection objects, or per-operation.  Generally, it makes the most sense to stick with the global default, <code>MONGOC_READ_PRIMARY</code>.  All of the other modes come with caveats that won't be covered in great detail here.</p>

  <section id="tag-sets">
    <title>Tag Sets</title>
    <p>Tag sets allow you to specify custom read preferences and write concerns so that your application can target operations to specific members.</p>
    <p>Custom read preferences and write concerns evaluate tags sets in different ways: read preferences consider the value of a tag when selecting a member to read from. while write concerns ignore the value of a tag to when selecting a member except to consider whether or not the value is unique.</p>

    <p>You can specify tag sets with the following read preference modes:</p>

    <list>
      <item><p>primaryPreferred</p></item>
      <item><p>secondary</p></item>
      <item><p>secondaryPreferred</p></item>
      <item><p>nearest</p></item>
    </list>

    <p>Tags are not compatible with <code>MONGOC_READ_PRIMARY</code> and, in general, only apply when selecting a secondary member of a set for a read operation. However, the nearest read mode, when combined with a tag set will select the nearest member that matches the specified tag set, which may be a primary or secondary.</p>

    <p>All interfaces use the same member selection logic to choose the member to which to direct read operations, basing the choice on read preference mode and tag sets.</p>
