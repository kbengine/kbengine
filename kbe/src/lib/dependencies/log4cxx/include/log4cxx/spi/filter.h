        /**
        Users should extend this class to implement customized logging
        event filtering. Note that Logger and
        AppenderSkeleton, the parent class of all standard
        appenders, have built-in filtering rules. It is suggested that you
        first use and understand the built-in rules before rushing to write
        your own custom filters.

        <p>This abstract class assumes and also imposes that filters be
        organized in a linear chain. The {@link #decide
        decide(LoggingEvent)} method of each filter is called sequentially,
        in the order of their addition to the chain.

        <p>The {@link #decide decide(LoggingEvent)} method must return one
        of the integer constants #DENY, #NEUTRAL or
        #ACCEPT.

        <p>If the value #DENY is returned, then the log event is
        dropped immediately without consulting with the remaining
        filters.

        <p>If the value #NEUTRAL is returned, then the next filter
        in the chain is consulted. If there are no more filters in the
        chain, then the log event is logged. Thus, in the presence of no
        filters, the default behaviour is to log all logging events.

        <p>If the value #ACCEPT is returned, then the log
        event is logged without consulting the remaining filters.

        <p>The philosophy of log4cxx filters is largely inspired from the
        Linux ipchains.

        <p>Note that filtering is only supported by the {@link
        xml::DOMConfigurator DOMConfigurator}.
