/* Header for dynamic hash table routines
 * Author - Eric Young
 */
/* ... erm yeah, "dynamic hash tables" you say?
 * 
 * And what would dynamic hash tables have to do with any of this code *now*?
 * AFAICS, this code is only referenced by crypto/bn/exp.c which is an unused
 * file that I doubt compiles any more. speed.c is the only thing that could
 * use this (and it has nothing to do with hash tables), yet it instead has its
 * own duplication of all this stuff and looks, if anything, more complete. See
 * the corresponding note in apps/speed.c.
