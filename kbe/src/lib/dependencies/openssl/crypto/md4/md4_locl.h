 * *_block_host_order is expected to handle aligned data while
 * *_block_data_order - unaligned. As algorithm and host (x86)
 * are in this case of the same "endianness" these two are
 * otherwise indistinguishable. But normally you don't want to
 * call the same function because unaligned access in places
 * where alignment is expected is usually a "Bad Thing". Indeed,
 * on RISCs you get punished with BUS ERROR signal or *severe*
 * performance degradation. Intel CPUs are in turn perfectly
 * capable of loading unaligned data without such drastic side
 * effect. Yes, they say it's slower than aligned load, but no
 * exception is generated and therefore performance degradation
 * is *incomparable* with RISCs. What we should weight here is
 * costs of unaligned access against costs of aligning data.
 * According to my measurements allowing unaligned access results
 * in ~9% performance improvement on Pentium II operating at
 * 266MHz. I won't be surprised if the difference will be higher
 * on faster systems:-)
