version 1.32.15        Feb 27th 2007
  Bugfix:
    makesmtpmessage now uses strftime to format date string for email headers. sn4k3 suggestion
    Bcc no longer added to header. bugfix, Should never have been added to the envelope!

   Quick note have not touched the WIN32 code in a few years, also was coded in VC6 so way
   out of date. I do not change this code just here for the chance that it will work in windows
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.13        Jul 4th 2006
  Bugfix:
    mailer.cpp warning about type hiding mailer::type (changed to typ)
	Winfried Mevenkamp pointed out possible buffer overflow after recv calls, fixed by making
	all recv calls say the buffer is one shorter than passed e.g.
	   Recv(len1, s, buff, buffsize -1, 0);
	then
	   buff[len1] = '\0';
	does not overwrite if buffsize characters are received.
   Added Closesocket cleanup call if error in dns code line 1113 (also Winfried's suggestion).

  Bugfix:
    checkRFCcompat() invalidates iterator!

version 1.32.11        May 15th 2005
  Bugfix:
    On the BSD's will not compile because of the timezone function. Corrected
	 this to use the tm structure tm_gmtoff member instead. mailer.cpp Line 771
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.10        May 2005
  Bugfix:
    Forgot to clear the headerline variable in makesmtpmessage (line 894)
	 results in extra attachment artifacts. Thanks Jim Steel for the pointer
	 and fix.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.9        April 2005
  Bugfix:
    When attaching files with filename less than 4 characters causes terminate
    call as substr is overrun, big oopsy. Can now attach files of 1 character
    and up, as it should be, wow what an idiot
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.8        20th March 2005
  Optimization:
    when attaching file/message makesmtpmessage used to convert between strings
    and vectors i.e. loop over every character in a vector and place it in a
    string. When attaching large files/messages you should see a speed
    improvement.
  Bugfix:
    The Date header was still not correct, I have not been putting in the
    timezone offset. So added that, I hope the logic is correct. If you get mail
    with the time incorrect, let me know your timezone and how much the clock
    was out, maybe I can really understand what is going on then! (I think I got
    it right ***nirg***)
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.7        March 2005
  Minor bug fix.
  line 815 of mailer.cpp missing else clause
     (bug found by Thomas Pfl√ºger, Thanks)
   This did not upset the logic, just halted its processing.
   Essentially two if/else blocks were present instead of one.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.6        February 2005
  Minor bug fix.
  parseaddress has a minor bug, cuts off the end of a name outside of <> characters.
  if the name is at the beginning of the address i.e.
       "hoopla girl<hoopla@wibble.com>"
  ends up:
       "hoopla gir"
  If your intersted see line 1237 of mailer.cpp for explanation
    (bug found by David Irwin, thanks David)
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.5        October 2004
  Minor bug fixes.
  Replaced checklinesarelessthan1000chars with checkRFCcompat
     this function now also checks for invalid line breaks and fixes them up.
     qmail will no longer balk with ....Lame Server... issues.
     If a dot is in the message on a line by itself another dot is added to
     that line to stop premature message closing. (suggestion by David Irwin, thanks David)
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.4        August 2004
  Minor bug fix.
  Default mailer constructor does not set the authentication variables.
   This causes errors when not using authentication when using the default constructor.
     stupid error on my part, sorry.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.32.2        June 2004
  Added the ability to send HTML formatted mail.
  via:
     setmessageHTML
     setmessageHTMLfile
  functions.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.31.1        April 2004
  oops forgot to add the VC project files in last release.
  No other changes.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.31.0        April 2004
  Now under gnutools control
    i.e. ./configure  make  make install       dance

    plain auth may not work yet, oops sorry, could not test properly.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.30
  Now under the GNU GPL license
  makefile changes to make a library
    e.g.  make lib libinstall
    link dynamic -ljwsmtp or static /usr/local/lib/libjwsmtp.a
  added compatabilty code and moved most platform specifics from the mailer class
  removed bugs (send/recv returns not checked correctly in old code)
  removed errant MSG_DONTROUTE flags from network code. Fixes the case where
   no network errors are encountered when not using a local nameserver.
  added a sockaddr_in wrapper, life is easier for me now.
  everything is in the jwsmtp namespace, need to do this now jwsmtp::mailer(...)
  added default constructor + functions to get/set tan MX lookup
  added second demo program, the shortest usage of the mailer class.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.21
  added real email address functionality.
    i.e can now use:
        "foo bar <foo@bar.com>" or
        "<foo@bar.com> foo bar" or
        "foo@bar.com" for addresses
	incorporated suggestions by Ken Weinert to resolve SunOS issues.
    INTERFACE unchanged.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.20
  Removed duplicated code in 'parseRR( )' function.
  Removed extra vector in 'attach( )' function.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.19
  fixed problem in gethostaddresses:
  when an invalid nameserver is passed to the constructor and the servers
  address does not resolve in dns, the code hangs! forgot to return at this point.
  gethostaddresses now returns false at this point fixing this error.
  
  added Date to the SMTP header.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
version 1.18
  bug fix, attachments did not work for binary files as
  lines where longer than a 1000 characters, SMTP forbids
  this, base64encode function now adds a newline every 79
  chars into a line. Sorry stupid oversight on my part.

  Added funtions to change all the values in the mail
  message, recipients, servers etc..

  new functions:
    bool setserver(const std::string& nameserver_or_smtpserver);
	bool setsender(const std::string& newsender);
	void clearattachments();
	void reset(); // erase recipients, message, attachments, errors.
______________________________________________________________________________________________

version 1.17
  TO: Cc: Bcc: mail recipient capability added
  added a function to remove attachments.
  changed an existing function, does not break the interface
  as the extra argument has a default value
  i.e. addrecipient("someone@somewhere.net");
    is the same as:
	   addrecipient("someone@somewhere.net", mailer::TO);

  new function:
    bool mailer::removeattachment(const std::string& filename);
  changed functions

    bool addrecipient(const std::string& newrecipient, short recipient_type = TO /*CC, BCC*/);

    const static enum {SMTP_PORT = 25, DNS_PORT = 53}
______________________________________________________________________________________________

version 1.14
  multiple recipients capabaility added
