A quick n dirty history of jwSMTP:

I was interested in making my home network accessible through my firewall. I had
one of those little blue boxes with a web interface to control it. Didn't want 
to use ddns as at the time I did not have a domain name anyway. So I decided 
to have a program run on one of my servers that contacted the router parsed the 
data in it's data section and send out the router's public IP address to an 
email of my choosing. This was how the library was born.

Two problems basically had to be solved (with regard to the email part of the 
program): get the MX record of the server to send to and send the mail to this 
server. I started with a hard coded routine to just send to an SMTP server as 
this was the easiest part to code. Once that was up I set about coding the DNS 
part of the problem. A lot of sending packets to DNS servers to see if I 
understood what dns does and voila I had the two parts I needed. I realised 
after the program was written that the code was a really simple drop in for 
email send services in a program, so I ripped out that part of the code and 
turned it into a library which I released under the GPL.

April 2002 was the first sourceforge release.
