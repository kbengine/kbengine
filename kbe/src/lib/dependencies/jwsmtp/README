INSTALL
----------------------------
To just install the library
./configure
make
make install           (as root)

special note: If using MSYS or cygwin on windows do this:
LDFLAGS=-lwsock32 ./configure
make
make install           (as root)


To link against the library (replace <version> with the current jwSMTP version)
g++ myfile.cpp -o myprogram `pkg-config --libs --cflags jwsmtp-<version>`

or statically
g++ myfile.cpp -o myprogram `pkg-config --cflags jwsmtp-<version>` /usr/local/lib/libjwsmtp.a

if after compiling your own programs you get an error like this:
./myprogram: error while loading shared libraries: libjwsmtp-<version>.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
run ldconfig e.g.
su
ldconfig
If it still doesn't work check /etc/ld.so.conf, if the library path is not in
the file add it and run ldconfig again.

-----------------------------------------------------
Windows notes.
There is a file named mail.dsw for users of Visual C
(this is a VC version 6 file).
